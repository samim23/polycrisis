# Polycrisis Backend

## Overview

This is the backend code for the Polycrisis Guide project. It is a research AI agent designed to gather comprehensive biodiversity data. The agent uses browser automation and large language models to research biodiversity topics, extract relevant information, and compile detailed reports.

## Notice

**Polycrisis Guide** was developed by [Studio Samim](https://samim.ai) as part of an "AI Research Agent" project for a client in the financial risk management industry. The client wishes to remain anonymous but has agreed to allow this curation of information gathered with the same toolset to be made public.

Due to client contractual obligations, the backend code and data for the project cannot be shared publicly at this time. Stay tuned for more updates.
