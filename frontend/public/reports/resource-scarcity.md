# **Resource Scarcity **

> Generate on: 26.3.2025

## Overview

**Resource scarcity** refers to the growing imbalance between humanity’s demand for essential natural resources and the available supply. Unlike isolated shortages, resource scarcity is a **systemic risk** that can trigger a _polycrisis_ – a cluster of interrelated crises – with compounding effects across societies and ecosystems ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Chapter%20one%20and%20Chapter%20two,1)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20food%2C%20water%20and,expansion%20into%20secure%2C%20renewable%20energy)). Key resources such as **freshwater**, **food**, **energy**, and **critical minerals** underpin basic needs and economic activity; when these become scarce or unreliable, the impacts ripple through health, livelihoods, geopolitical stability, and the environment. In today’s interconnected world, resource scarcity seldom occurs in isolation – instead, it interacts with other global challenges like climate change and conflicts, potentially escalating into a multi-faceted crisis greater than the sum of its parts ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cpolycrisis%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20a%20cluster%20of,1)). Recognizing resource scarcity as a systemic risk is crucial, as it demands integrated solutions and collective action rather than siloed, resource-specific fixes.

## Current Status of Key Resources

**Freshwater:** Water scarcity is already a reality for billions. Roughly _3.6 billion people_ currently face water shortages at least one month per year, a figure projected to exceed 5 billion by 2050 ([State of Global Water Resources 2023](https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-global-water-resources-2023#:~:text=global%20dataset%20of%20hydrological%20variables,6%20on%20water%20and%20sanitation)). About half the world’s population is exposed to “extremely high” water stress during part of the year ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=A%20colour,of%20water%20stress%20on%20countries)). Many aquifers and rivers are over-exploited, and in 2023 global river runoffs were at their lowest in decades ([State of Global Water Resources 2023](https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-global-water-resources-2023#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20Global%20Water,of%20widespread%20ice%20loss%20globally)). Climate change and unsustainable use have **“broken the water cycle,”** contributing to severe droughts in some regions while others suffer catastrophic floods ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=A%20quarter%20of%20the%20world%27s,have%20been%20related%20to%20water)) ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=,Secretary%20General%20Antonio%20Guterres)). A quarter of the world’s people still rely on unsafe drinking water, reflecting not just physical scarcity but also poor infrastructure and governance ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=UNITED%20NATIONS%2C%20March%2022%20,one%20of%20humanity%27s%20shared%20resources)).

**Food:** After decades of progress, global hunger is again on the rise. In 2022, an estimated **783 million people** faced chronic undernourishment ([ — SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/Goal-12/#:~:text=annually%2C%20more%20than%20the%20weight,people%20faced%20hunger%20in%202022)), and about **345 million** experienced acute food insecurity (crisis levels requiring urgent assistance) – more than double the number in 2019 ([People facing acute food insecurity reach 345 million worldwide - WFP | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/people-facing-acute-food-insecurity-reach-340-million-worldwide-wfp-2022-08-24/#:~:text=BAGHDAD%2C%20Aug%2024%20%28Reuters%29%20,WFP%29%20said%20on%20Wednesday)). This spike has been driven by the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout, conflicts, and extreme weather events ([People facing acute food insecurity reach 345 million worldwide - WFP | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/people-facing-acute-food-insecurity-reach-340-million-worldwide-wfp-2022-08-24/#:~:text=BAGHDAD%2C%20Aug%2024%20%28Reuters%29%20,WFP%29%20said%20on%20Wednesday)) ([People facing acute food insecurity reach 345 million worldwide - WFP | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/people-facing-acute-food-insecurity-reach-340-million-worldwide-wfp-2022-08-24/#:~:text=,she%20said)). Key agricultural regions have been hit by droughts and heatwaves, reducing crop yields, while food supply chains have been disrupted by events like the war in Ukraine, which sent grain and fertilizer prices soaring ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)) ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=The%20health%20and%20economic%20aftereffects,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)). The result is a **global cost-of-living crisis** with food prices at painfully high levels in many countries, exacerbating malnutrition and pushing millions into poverty ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=reversal%20of%20recent%20progress,political%20upheaval%20and%20involuntary%20migration)).

**Energy:** Access to affordable energy is uneven, and recent crises have revealed its fragility. About **774–775 million people** worldwide still lack electricity access – a number that **increased** in 2022 for the first time in decades due to the pandemic slowdown and the global energy crisis ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=reversal%20of%20recent%20progress,political%20upheaval%20and%20involuntary%20migration)) ([For the first time in decades, the number of people without access to electricity is set to increase in 2022 – Analysis - IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/for-the-first-time-in-decades-the-number-of-people-without-access-to-electricity-is-set-to-increase-in-2022#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20IEA,back%20to%20its%202013%20peak)). Fossil fuel markets have been volatile: the 2022 war in Europe (Ukraine) led to fuel shortages and record prices, forcing some countries to ration energy and revert to coal ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)). While renewable energy capacity is growing, it hasn’t yet closed the gap for the energy poor. Furthermore, many nations face fuel scarcity or unaffordable prices, highlighting how geopolitical events can weaponize energy supply ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)). The energy shortfalls have fed into inflation, straining households and industries worldwide.

**Critical Minerals:** Modern technologies and the clean energy transition depend on a range of **critical minerals** (like lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths). Demand for these has surged, raising concerns about future scarcity. For example, meeting climate goals by 2050 could require a **500% increase** in production of minerals such as graphite, lithium, and cobalt compared to 2018 levels ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=between%20countries.,7)) ([Mineral Production to Soar as Demand for Clean Energy Increases ](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/05/11/mineral-production-to-soar-as-demand-for-clean-energy-increases#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20May%2011%2C%202020%20%E2%80%94,achieving%20a%20below%202%C2%B0C%20future)). Current supply chains are **highly concentrated** – a few countries dominate mining and processing – making this a strategic vulnerability. Already, shortages and price spikes have occurred for materials like lithium (used in batteries) as supply struggles to keep up. If unaddressed, mineral bottlenecks could slow down renewable energy deployment and industrial production, creating a new dimension of resource scarcity in the high-tech and energy sectors.

## Trends and Projections

**Short-Term (to 2030):** In the near term, resource pressures are expected to **intensify**. Global population is projected to reach **8.5 billion by 2030** ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20food%2C%20water%20and,expansion%20into%20secure%2C%20renewable%20energy)) ([Global population to hit 8 billion mark Tuesday, U.N. says | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/global-population-to-hit-8-billion-mark-tuesday-u-n-says#:~:text=and%20challenging%20policies%20aimed%20to,report%20said)), adding demand for food, water, and energy. Economic development in emerging markets is boosting consumption: global food demand is growing ~1.4% per year, outpacing the ~1.1% annual increase in food production ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20food%2C%20water%20and,expansion%20into%20secure%2C%20renewable%20energy)). This implies tightening food balances and risk of persistent price rises or shortages. Freshwater demand is on course to overshoot sustainable supply – one estimate projects a **40% gap** between global water supply and demand by 2030 ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=2030,7)). Urbanization and industrialization in Asia and Africa are driving up water usage dramatically, far faster than new supply can be secured. In energy, despite expanding renewables, many regions will remain dependent on oil and gas this decade, leaving them vulnerable to supply shocks. Short-term climate forecasts (e.g. continued warming, more frequent droughts) suggest resource production will be increasingly disrupted, making scarcity events (like drought-induced crop failures or power blackouts) more common. Experts warn that without urgent action, the later 2020s could see **synchronous crises** – for example, simultaneous crop failures and energy crunches – fueling a global polycrisis ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Chapter%20one%20and%20Chapter%20two,1)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=connections%20between%20the%20emerging%20risks,and%20risk%20mitigation%20efforts%20today)).

**Mid-Term (2030–2050):** Over a couple of decades, structural trends could either worsen or alleviate resource scarcity. On the current trajectory, **demand-supply imbalances** will grow. Water stress will spread: by 2050 up to **60% of the global population** could face water scarcity at least seasonally ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=A%20colour,of%20water%20stress%20on%20countries)). Climate change impacts will be much more pronounced by 2050, with higher temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns significantly reducing renewable freshwater in many regions (while a few high-latitude areas see gains) ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=have%20high%20vulnerability%20to%20climatic,Although)) ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=overall%20agricultural%20productivity%20has%20increased%2C,in%20extreme%20heat%20events%20have)). Agricultural productivity needs to rise ~50% by 2050 to feed nearly 10 billion people, yet climate change may depress global crop yields by 2–8% per decade without adaptation ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=from%20floods%2C%20droughts%20and%20storms,food%20production%20from%20fisheries%20and)). **Resource demand** for industrial and technological uses will also balloon – for instance, the push for clean energy means exponential growth in minerals extraction (annual critical mineral demand for clean tech in 2050 is anticipated to reach 450% of 2018 levels) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=between%20countries.,7)). This mid-century scramble could lead to intense “resource **competition**,” where nations and corporations vie for control of key supplies. However, the mid-term future is not set in stone: increased efficiency, technological breakthroughs (such as drought-resistant crops or advanced recycling), and international resource-sharing agreements could moderate these trends. Some projections show food and water scarcity easing after 2030 in scenarios with aggressive investment in sustainability and climate mitigation ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=,as%20key%20forces%20for%20disruption)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Resource%20collaboration%20%E2%80%93%20the,humanitarian%20crisis%20in%20developing%20nations)). The degree of **global cooperation** and climate action taken in the 2020s will largely determine whether 2030–2050 is an era of escalating resource crises or a transition toward stabilization ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=In%20the%202030%20time%20frame%2C,carbon%20transition%20%28Box%203.1)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20these%20two%20axes%20lead,four%20hypothetical%20futures%20for%202030)).

**Long-Term (2050+):** Looking toward the second half of the century, uncertainty grows, but two broad scenarios emerge. In a **pessimistic scenario** of continued high consumption and insufficient climate action, resource scarcities could become chronic and severe. By 2100, global population might peak around 10–11 billion, and if per capita resource use remains high, we would far exceed planetary boundaries. Climate change in that scenario (3°C+ warming) would drastically alter water availability (glacier melt and depleted aquifers in Asia, desertification in subtropics) and cut global crop yields, causing permanent food insecurity in parts of the world. Critical minerals for technology might become extremely expensive or effectively exhausted in accessible forms, stalling economic progress. This could lead to **permanent polycrisis** conditions: widespread famines, mass displacement from uninhabitable dry regions, and conflict over remaining resources. In an **optimistic scenario**, by contrast, humanity might adapt via a combination of innovation and behavior change: large-scale desalination and water recycling could relieve water stress; advanced sustainable agriculture (e.g. vertical farms, lab-grown meat) could secure food supply; abundant clean energy (solar, wind, possibly fusion) could replace fossil fuels and even power carbon capture to restore climate stability. Under such conditions, global resource use might plateau or decline after 2050 (through circular economy practices and lower population growth), easing scarcity. Most likely, reality will fall somewhere between these extremes. Even in the best case, **regional scarcities** will persist (due to local limits), and ongoing vigilance will be needed to manage resources fairly and sustainably. The long-term trajectory hinges on decisions made now: whether we continue on a **“vampiric” overconsumption path or shift to renewal and stewardship** will decide if resource scarcity in 2100 is a manageable challenge or an existential crisis ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=Sign%20up%20here)).

## Key Drivers and Mechanisms

Resource scarcity is driven by a web of **underlying factors** that span demographic, economic, environmental, and political realms. Major drivers and mechanisms include:

- **Population Growth and Urbanization:** More people equates to higher demand for water, food, and energy. The global population adds over 70 million people each year, each needing basic resources. Rapid urbanization concentrates demand in cities, often far from sources, straining supply networks for water and power ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20food%2C%20water%20and,expansion%20into%20secure%2C%20renewable%20energy)). By sheer numbers, an 8.5+ billion world in 2030 (and ~10 billion by mid-century) requires unprecedented resource provision ([Global population to hit 8 billion mark Tuesday, U.N. says | PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/global-population-to-hit-8-billion-mark-tuesday-u-n-says#:~:text=and%20challenging%20policies%20aimed%20to,report%20said)).

- **Unsustainable Consumption Patterns:** Per capita resource use is very high, especially in wealthy nations. The global **material footprint** – the total raw materials consumed – reached about **98 billion tons in 2022**, up 71% since 2000 ([ — SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/Goal-12/#:~:text=cent%20in%202013,9%20per%20cent%20in)). Humanity currently uses **75% more resources each year than the Earth can regenerate**, leading to an ecological deficit ([Earth Overshoot Day 2023 – Geneva Environment Network](https://www.genevaenvironmentnetwork.org/events/earth-overshoot-day-2023/#:~:text=2%20August%202023)) ([Earth Overshoot Day 2023 – Geneva Environment Network](https://www.genevaenvironmentnetwork.org/events/earth-overshoot-day-2023/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Earth%20Overshoot%20Day,operates%20on%20ecological%20deficit%20spending)). This “overshoot” means we are depleting groundwater, soil fertility, fish stocks, and mineral reserves faster than they can be replenished. High meat diets, throwaway consumer goods, and energy-intensive lifestyles all drive this overconsumption.

- **Economic Development and Poverty:** As developing countries industrialize and incomes rise, billions of people understandably seek better living standards. This **increases resource demand** (for example, more diverse diets, vehicle ownership, and electricity use). On the other hand, extreme poverty also drives resource depletion in a different way – for instance, communities may over-harvest forests or fisheries to survive. Inefficient technologies (e.g. old power grids, leaky irrigation) common in poorer regions waste significant amounts of resources. Thus both affluence and poverty, in different ways, contribute to stress on resources.

- **Climate Change:** Global warming acts as a threat multiplier for resource scarcity. Higher temperatures and shifting weather patterns directly reduce the **supply** of some resources – e.g. changing rainfall and melting glaciers lead to water scarcity and more frequent droughts, while heat stress and unpredictable weather lower crop yields ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=have%20high%20vulnerability%20to%20climatic,Although)) ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=overall%20agricultural%20productivity%20has%20increased%2C,in%20extreme%20heat%20events%20have)). Climate extremes (droughts, floods, storms) have already **exposed millions to acute food and water insecurity** ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=extreme%20events%20have%20exposed%20millions,Although)). Climate change also forces a pivot in energy systems (from fossil fuels to renewables), which in the short term increases demand for certain minerals and land, potentially creating new scarcities. In sum, climate change both **exacerbates resource shortages** and **undermines the stability** of resource production systems.

- **Environmental Degradation:** Beyond climate, other human impacts on ecosystems reduce resource availability. Deforestation and soil erosion diminish the land’s capacity to produce food and regulate water. Overpumping of groundwater leads to depleted aquifers (e.g. parts of India and the Middle East are facing collapsing water tables). Pollution and overfishing have emptied out many fisheries. Biodiversity loss can harm crop pollination and pest control, undermining agriculture. These degradations mean the **natural systems that supply our resources are weakening**, making scarcity more likely even if demand stayed constant.

- **Geopolitical Factors and Conflict:** Politics strongly influence resource distribution. **Conflicts can disrupt supply** lines (as seen when war in Ukraine blocked grain exports and cut off energy supplies ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries))) and damage infrastructure like irrigation systems or power grids. Geopolitical rivalries can limit trade: countries might hoard or restrict exports of critical resources (such as rare earth metals or food staples) for strategic reasons. There’s also the specter of **“resource nationalism”** – governments securing resources for themselves at others’ expense – which can intensify scarcity in import-dependent nations. In extreme cases, outright wars could be fought over water rights, fertile land, or oil fields, directly destroying resources and diverting huge expenditures into conflict rather than resource management.

- **Extraction Rates and Finite Supplies:** Many resources are being extracted at unsustainable rates. Non-renewable resources (fossil fuels, minerals) are by definition finite; the easiest accessible reserves are often depleted first, leaving more marginal, costly, or environmentally damaging sources to be tapped. Some analyses suggest we are nearing “peak” production for certain minerals. Even renewable resources (water, forests, fisheries) can effectively become finite if overuse exceeds regeneration. The **over-extraction** today eats into the stock meant for tomorrow, setting up a collapse when limits are finally hit. Technological advancements have postponed some limits (for example, new drilling methods unlocked more oil and gas), but often at higher costs or environmental risk, and cannot create infinite supply.

- **Poor Governance and Inefficiency:** A less visible but critical driver is how resources are managed. In many places, **inefficient irrigation** wastes huge volumes of water, electricity is lost to outdated grids, and food is lost to spoilage due to inadequate storage. Subsidies can encourage waste (e.g. cheap gasoline leading to excessive use). Corruption or mismanagement can result in resources not reaching those who need them (as when water utilities fail to deliver to the poor, prompting unsustainable well-digging). Lack of international coordination means shared resources (like rivers or fish stocks) are often overused (the tragedy of the commons). Thus, governance failures amplify scarcity beyond what “natural” factors would dictate, turning what could be a manageable challenge into a crisis.

## Impacts and Cascading Effects

When vital resources become scarce, the **impacts cascade** through virtually every aspect of human well-being and planetary health. Some key impacts and knock-on effects include:

- **Health and Human Development:** Scarcity of food and water directly causes malnutrition and dehydration, leading to stunting in children, weakened immune systems, and higher mortality rates. Water scarcity often results in poor sanitation (due to lack of water for hygiene) and outbreaks of water-borne diseases like cholera ([Water scarcity | UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/wash/water-scarcity#:~:text=Water%20scarcity%20limits%20access%20to,water%20also%20becomes%20more%20expensive)). Energy poverty means clinics without power, and families resorting to polluting fuels that cause indoor air pollution. In essence, resource scarcity threatens basic health, reduces life expectancy, and stalls progress on development goals. A hungry, thirsty population cannot be productive – children miss school to fetch water, and the sick cannot work, creating a vicious cycle of poverty.

- **Economic Strain and Inequality:** Scarce resources drive up prices – we’ve seen sharp spikes in food and energy prices in recent years due to shortages ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)). This fuels inflation and erodes household incomes, often hitting the poorest hardest (they spend a larger share on essentials). Industries reliant on raw materials face higher input costs and may scale back production or pass costs to consumers. Entire economies can tip into recession from a major resource shock (e.g. an oil supply crunch causing global downturn). Furthermore, competition for scarce inputs can favor those with more wealth or power, **widening inequality** both within and between countries. For instance, richer countries can outbid poorer ones for LNG gas cargos or grain supplies, leaving poorer nations in crisis. Such economic stress can also strain government budgets (through subsidies or emergency relief efforts), potentially leading to debt problems or cuts in other services.

- **Food and Water Security:** At the extreme, resource scarcity can lead to **famine** or **water crisis** conditions. Crop failures in multiple breadbasket regions could spark a global food shortage, leaving millions without enough food. Localized water scarcity can mean certain cities or communities literally run out of water (so-called “Day Zero” events, as nearly happened in Cape Town and Chennai). Even before total depletion, chronic scarcity means permanent undernourishment for segments of the population and reliance on emergency aid. These conditions, if persistent, cause long-term developmental damage and can render certain regions incapable of supporting their populations.

- **Social Unrest and Conflict:** Scarcity can become a flashpoint for **social instability**. History shows that surging bread or fuel prices often trigger protests, riots, and in some cases the overthrow of governments (for example, high food prices were a factor in the Arab Spring unrest). When people cannot secure basic necessities, frustration can boil over into violence or radicalization. At a community level, water or grazing shortages can spark communal conflicts (farmers vs. herders, upstream vs. downstream users). At a national level, if a government is seen as failing to provide or as favoring certain groups in resource allocation, it can inflame ethnic or regional tensions. In the worst case, nations might go to war over resources – so-called “water wars” between countries that share a river basin, or conflicts over oilfields and mineral deposits. Scarcity thus can both result from conflict and be a cause of new conflicts, creating a dangerous feedback loop.

- **Geopolitical Shifts:** As resources become more scarce, they attain greater **geostrategic importance**. Countries may forge new alliances or rivalries based on resource needs – for example, resource-rich countries (with oil, lithium, fertile land, etc.) gain leverage, while resource-import dependent nations feel increasing insecurity. Trade patterns might shift: essential goods like food grains or rare minerals could become instruments of diplomacy or coercion (“weaponized” resources). We already see examples: fertilizer and grain exports being restricted, or critical mineral supplies being used as bargaining chips. Scarcity may also prompt powers to extend their influence to secure resources (e.g. investments in land abroad, or even neo-colonial extraction arrangements), affecting global power balances. International relations could become more tense and crisis-prone under resource stress scenarios, undermining cooperation just when it’s most needed.

- **Human Displacement and Migration:** When regions can no longer support their populations due to resource deficits (crop failures, water depletion, fisheries collapse), people are often forced to migrate. **Environmental migrants** or **resource refugees** leave their homes in search of food or work, both within countries (rural to urban moves) and across borders. For instance, prolonged droughts and desertification in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Central America have already contributed to migration surges. The UN estimates that intense water scarcity alone could displace 700 million people by 2030 if adaptive measures fail ([Water scarcity | UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/wash/water-scarcity#:~:text=,of%20extremely%20high%20water%20stress)). Large-scale displacement can lead to humanitarian crises, and receiving areas (cities or neighboring countries) can themselves come under strain, potentially sparking further instability.

- **Ecosystem Collapse:** Human appropriation of resources often means less available for ecosystems. Rivers running dry from overuse leave wetlands and lakes desiccated, harming fish and wildlife. Overfishing and ocean warming together push fisheries to collapse, damaging marine ecosystems. Forests cleared or stressed by drought lose biodiversity and carbon-sinking capacity, contributing back to climate change. In a way, resource scarcity for humans usually goes hand in hand with resource scarcity for other species, leading to biodiversity loss and even ecosystem collapse. Such environmental breakdown in turn loops back to hurt humans (loss of pollinators, degraded soil, etc., reducing nature’s services that we rely on). A systemic perspective sees human well-being and ecosystem health as interdependent; a crisis in one is a crisis in the other.

- **Second-Order Crises (Cascades):** One scarcity can trigger another. For example, an energy shortage (like lack of fuel) can hamper food production and distribution (tractors can’t run, supply trucks idle), worsening a food crisis. A water crisis can quickly turn into a health crisis if sanitation fails and disease spreads. Economic collapse due to resource shock can lead to political crisis or conflict, which then further disrupts resources in a vicious cycle. These cascading effects mean a shock in one domain (say, a bad harvest) can propagate into multi-dimensional disaster (famine + unrest + regional conflict). Systemic risk lies in these interconnections: a failure in one part (like a key “node” of food supply) can bring down many others. Ultimately, severe resource scarcity can threaten societal stability at its core, undermining trust in institutions, and can even become an existential risk if multiple life-sustaining systems falter simultaneously.

## Geographic Variations in Vulnerability

Resource scarcity is **unevenly distributed** across the globe. Some regions are far more vulnerable due to geography, climate, population pressures, and socioeconomic factors:

- **Water Scarcity Hotspots:** Arid and semi-arid regions face chronic water deficits. The Middle East and North Africa is the most water-scarce region in the world – countries like **Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan** and others withdraw over 80% of their available water annually ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=between%2020)) ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=The%2025%20countries%20under%20the,Cyprus%2C%20Kuwait%2C%20Lebanon%20and%20Oman)), relying heavily on unsustainable groundwater mining and desalination. South Asia (India, Pakistan) and parts of China also face severe seasonal water stress due to monsoon dependence and shrinking glaciers. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Horn of Africa and Sahel frequently suffer from droughts and water shortages that devastate crops and livelihoods. Small island states have limited freshwater sources and are highly vulnerable to drought and saline intrusion.

- **Food Insecurity and Famine-Prone Areas:** Regions already facing conflict and climate extremes are at highest risk of food crises. East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen) has seen recurring famines or near-famines as drought combines with conflict and poverty. South Asia has the largest number of undernourished people (especially in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan), even though it’s a major food-producing region – distribution and affordability issues create pockets of hunger. In contrast, many wealthy nations in North America and Europe have more stable food supplies and can import what they lack; they experience food insecurity mainly as a matter of cost for the poorest, not absolute availability. However, even developed regions are not immune to spikes in prices or certain shortages (as seen with the 2022 infant formula shortage in the US, or panic buying of staples in Europe during the pandemic).

- **Energy Access and Security:** Sub-Saharan Africa is the epicenter of energy poverty – over half of the global population without electricity lives in this region, notably in rural parts of Nigeria, DR Congo, Ethiopia, etc. ([For the first time in decades, the number of people without access to electricity is set to increase in 2022 – Analysis - IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/for-the-first-time-in-decades-the-number-of-people-without-access-to-electricity-is-set-to-increase-in-2022#:~:text=without%20electricity%20is%20set%20to,back%20to%20its%202013%20peak)). South Asia also has significant pockets of energy poverty (e.g. unelectrified villages in India). On the flip side, many European nations, Japan, and some others are heavily import-dependent for energy (oil/gas), making them vulnerable to geopolitical supply disruptions despite being rich – Europe’s scramble for gas in 2022 is an example. The Middle East, while rich in oil, faces its own energy dilemma as its domestic demand rises and it remains water-scarce (leading to energy-intensive desalination). Countries endowed with renewables potential (sunny, windy, etc.) and those who invested early in diverse energy sources are somewhat more insulated.

- **Critical Minerals and Manufacturing:** Countries like **China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, Chile, and South Africa** hold the majority of reserves or production for various critical minerals (from rare earths to cobalt and lithium). This concentration means other regions (North America, Europe, parts of Asia) are highly dependent on imports for these materials. China’s dominance in refining (e.g. ~60–70% of cobalt and rare earth processing) means that even if minerals are mined elsewhere, bottlenecks can occur in refining capacity ([Mineral Demands for Resilient Semiconductor Supply Chains - CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=Gallium%20supply%20is%20overwhelmingly%20concentrated,of%20total%20gallium%20coming)). Regions that lack both reserves and processing (like Europe for rare earths, or much of Asia for lithium) are vulnerable to supply squeezes. This could become a major strategic vulnerability if geopolitical tensions cut off mineral supply lines.

- **Developed vs Developing Disparities:** Generally, **developing countries** face greater resource vulnerability because they often lack capital for mitigation (like infrastructure, imports, tech fixes) and have rapidly growing populations. Many also have economies closely tied to natural resources (agriculture, mining) which climate impacts can destabilize. **Developed countries** have more buffers – strategic reserves, diversified import sources, more efficient technologies, and wealth to purchase scarce resources at higher prices – but they are not shielded from global trends. Importantly, within countries there are disparities: marginalized and low-income communities suffer first and worst from resource scarcities (e.g. poor urban neighborhoods may get intermittent water while affluent areas in the same city have continuous supply).

- **Distributional Asymmetries:** Some nations are **resource-rich but institution-poor** – for example, countries in Latin America or Africa that have abundant water or minerals but due to lack of infrastructure or governance, those resources do not translate to local abundance (paradoxically they experience scarcity amid plenty). Other nations are **resource-poor but wealthier** and manage by importing heavily (e.g. Singapore imports over 90% of its food). This creates a global interdependence: food-exporting breadbaskets (U.S., Brazil, Ukraine pre-war, etc.) feed import-dependent populous countries (Middle East, parts of Asia). Any shock in one reverberates in the other. As scarcity worsens, these trade linkages can become points of tension – e.g. if exporters impose bans to protect their own supply, importers face crisis. The unequal distribution of resources – water concentrated in some basins, oil in certain geologies, fertile land in temperate zones – means **global cooperation** and trade are literally lifesaving for some regions, yet those same asymmetries can fuel power imbalances and exploitation.

## Adaptation and Mitigation Efforts

Given the high stakes, a range of **responses** are underway to tackle resource scarcity – from local initiatives to global frameworks – though their effectiveness varies:

- **Policy Shifts and Governance Reforms:** Many governments are drafting policies to manage resources more sustainably. For instance, national water plans focusing on conservation, efficiency, and allocation are being implemented in water-stressed countries (like India’s water mission or Saudi Arabia’s desalination and efficiency programs). Land use policies to prevent over-farming and preserve critical ecosystems (like Brazil’s efforts – albeit fluctuating – to curb deforestation in the Amazon) are aimed at safeguarding future resources. Some regions have established transboundary agreements for shared rivers and aquifers to reduce conflict risk (e.g. the Indus Waters Treaty, though strained, or new cooperative frameworks being discussed for the Nile and Tigris-Euphrates). There’s also growing attention to **governance** – improving institutions that manage resources (for example, creating water regulatory authorities, enforcing fishing quotas, or anti-corruption drives in mining sectors) so that resources are allocated fairly and efficiently.

- **Technological Innovation:** Technology is a critical part of the solution mix. Advances in **agriculture** (drought-tolerant crop varieties, precision farming that optimizes water and fertilizer use, lab-grown meat and alternative proteins) aim to produce more food with less input. **Water technologies** like desalination (turning seawater to fresh water) and wastewater recycling are expanding in places like Israel, Singapore, and California, easing local scarcity – although they come with energy costs. Renewable energy technology has seen perhaps the most dramatic progress: solar and wind power costs have plummeted, making clean energy more viable and reducing dependence on depletable fossil fuels. There are also efforts in **energy storage (batteries)**, **smart grids**, and potentially even nuclear fusion to provide abundant clean energy in the long run. For critical minerals, researchers are working on material substitutes (using more common materials in place of rare ones), improved recycling (urban mining of e-waste for precious metals), and better batteries that use less scarce elements. **Efficiency innovations** – from electric vehicles (reducing oil use) to LED lighting (saving electricity) – effectively create “new” resources by freeing up supply that would have been wasted. Technology, however, is not a silver bullet; it needs supportive policy and funding, and often time to scale up, which is why both innovation and conservation are pursued in parallel.

- **International Cooperation and Agreements:** Recognizing that resource issues cross borders, global cooperation is being pursued on multiple fronts. The Paris Climate Agreement (2015) and subsequent COP meetings, while focused on emissions, also indirectly address resource issues by aiming to limit climate damage to food and water systems. In 2023, the UN held its first water conference in decades, resulting in a “Water Action Agenda” – a compendium of voluntary commitments by countries to improve water management ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=UNITED%20NATIONS%2C%20March%2022%20,one%20of%20humanity%27s%20shared%20resources)) ([UN warns 'vampiric overconsumption' is draining world's water | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-warns-vampiric-overconsumption-is-draining-worlds-water-2023-03-22/#:~:text=Ensuring%20access%20to%20clean%20drinking,taking%20action%20on%20climate%20change)). There are international initiatives like the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** which set targets for clean water (SDG6), zero hunger (SDG2), affordable clean energy (SDG7), etc., to be achieved by 2030 – these have galvanized governments and organizations, though progress is mixed. The FAO, WFP, and others coordinate to address acute food crises through funding appeals and food aid. At the strategic level, forums like the G20 and World Economic Forum have been urging collaboration to avoid “resource rivalries” and instead promote shared solutions and resource trade security ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=In%20the%202030%20time%20frame%2C,carbon%20transition%20%28Box%203.1)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20these%20two%20axes%20lead,four%20hypothetical%20futures%20for%202030)). Some new coalitions are forming, for example: partnerships for critical minerals (like the Minerals Security Partnership among some Western nations) to diversify supply, or regional power grids to share energy. While **international cooperation** has had successes (e.g. ozone layer protection, or joint management of the Mekong River in parts), it often falls victim to geopolitical tensions. Nonetheless, the complexity of resource scarcity is pushing a recognition that “we either solve this together or not at all,” leading to at least dialogue and knowledge-sharing as first steps.

- **Market and Economic Adjustments:** Market mechanisms are also helping to mitigate scarcity in some cases. High prices for scarce resources incentivize both increased supply (e.g. more mining or drilling ventures when mineral or oil prices rise) and demand reduction or substitution (consumers insulating homes when heating oil is expensive, or switching to bicycles when fuel is costly). There’s growing interest in **circular economy** models – businesses redesigning products for reuse, recycling, and longevity (for instance, battery recycling programs to reclaim lithium, or water recycling in industries). Some governments and companies are investing in strategic **stockpiles** or buffer reserves (as China has done for grains and metals, or many countries do with petroleum reserves) to cushion against short-term shortages. Trade diversification is another strategy – not relying on a single source country for critical imports. Additionally, more companies and financial institutions are incorporating resource risk into their planning: for example, investors might shy away from water-intensive projects in arid regions, and food companies are working directly with farmers on climate adaptation to secure their supply chains. While market forces alone won’t equitably solve scarcity (markets don’t automatically ensure poor communities get water, for instance), when paired with policy (like pricing carbon or charging for water usage), they can drive efficiency and innovation.

- **Community-Level and Bottom-Up Initiatives:** On the ground, many communities are not waiting for top-down solutions. Local water stewardship groups, farmer cooperatives, and urban community gardens are examples of people organizing to manage resources sustainably. Traditional knowledge in indigenous communities is being revisited for sustainable practices (such as drought-resistant cropping methods or forest conservation approaches). NGOs and local governments run education campaigns on conservation – from rainwater harvesting in water-scarce villages to reducing food waste in cities (food waste reduction is crucial given nearly 1/5 of food is wasted, straining resources needlessly ([ — SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/Goal-12/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2013,people%20faced%20hunger%20in%202022)) ([ — SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/Goal-12/#:~:text=to%20increased%20consumption%20of%20fresh,and%20reducing%20losses%20by%202030))). Empowering women has a notable impact: since women often manage household water and food, their education and involvement in resource governance (e.g. as leaders of water user associations) has improved outcomes in some regions. These micro-level efforts, when scaled up or networked, contribute significantly – for instance, **reforestation and soil restoration** by communities can replenish groundwater and improve food security over time. The challenge is that local efforts can be overwhelmed by larger forces (like climate change or national policy), so they need support and enabling environments to flourish.

**Effectiveness of Current Responses:** The results so far are mixed. There are success stories: some countries have dramatically improved water efficiency (Israel recycles ~90% of wastewater for agriculture), some have virtually eliminated hunger, and renewable energy is expanding rapidly. Yet, globally, we are not on track to meet key SDGs on hunger, water, or energy by 2030 – progress has stalled or reversed ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=crises%3A%20cost%20of%20living%2C%20social,and%20geopolitical%20confrontation%2C%20among%20others)) ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=from%20floods%2C%20droughts%20and%20storms,food%20production%20from%20fisheries%20and)). Current responses often lack the **scale or urgency** to match growing demand. International cooperation is hampered by nationalism and competition (e.g. climate action is behind schedule, and food aid appeals are often underfunded). Technological solutions face bottlenecks of investment and time – for example, desalination can’t be deployed fast enough to help regions currently in crisis, and breakthroughs like drought-proof crops may come too late for some. Additionally, some responses are treating symptoms (sending food aid) rather than causes (improving local agriculture and peace). However, awareness is rising that piecemeal efforts won’t suffice; integrated approaches (like linking climate policy with food and water policy) are starting to be discussed. The **effectiveness** will ultimately depend on political will and societal commitment – current efforts have shown what works in principle, but **scaling up** those successes in a cohesive way remains an urgent task for the global community.

## Critical Uncertainties

While trends indicate worsening scarcity, there are significant uncertainties that could alter the risk trajectory, making resource scarcity an area of **contested futures**:

- **Technological Breakthroughs:** A major uncertainty is whether humanity will develop and deploy new technologies in time to dramatically boost resource availability or efficiency. Optimistic scenarios bank on breakthroughs – for example, **cheap energy storage or fusion power** could provide virtually unlimited clean energy, which in turn could power desalination and indoor farming at scale, relieving water and food stress. Similarly, synthetic foods or GMO crops might greatly increase food production with fewer inputs. If such innovations arrive by 2030 or 2040, they could considerably mitigate scarcity. However, it’s uncertain which breakthroughs will materialize, when, and how widely they will be adopted. Betting on future tech is risky; delays or failures in innovation would leave us confronting scarcity with current tools.

- **Climate Trajectory:** The extent of climate change is a huge uncertainty. If global warming is kept to 1.5–2°C, many resource systems (though stressed) might adapt or be manageable. But if we end up on a 3–4°C path by late century, the effects on water (massive droughts, glacier loss), agriculture (frequent crop failures, heat beyond crop tolerance), and habitability (parts of tropics becoming too hot or dry for dense populations) could push resource systems to breaking points. There’s also uncertainty in regional climate impacts – e.g., will the monsoons weaken or just become erratic? Will the Amazon forest tip into collapse (disrupting rainfall across a continent) or hold? These factors will critically shape future resource availability. Even with the same global warming level, local impacts could differ widely based on chaotic climate variability.

- **Policy and Behavioral Change:** Human choices are the biggest wildcard. Will the world significantly **change consumption patterns** and move toward sustainability, or continue business-as-usual? For instance, if societies embrace plant-based diets and reduce meat consumption, that could free up a lot of land and water. If we redesign cities for efficiency (public transport, green buildings), energy demand could stabilize or drop. Alternatively, if emerging economies adopt the same car-centric, meat-heavy lifestyles of wealthy countries without efficiency improvements, resource demand will skyrocket. Political will is uncertain too: effective carbon pricing, water rights reform, or investment in climate adaptation depends on future governments. Societal values – whether we prioritize conservation and equity or not – will drive policy. These “soft” factors are hard to predict but extremely influential on outcomes.

- **Economic and Geopolitical Trajectories:** The stability of the global economy and geopolitical relations adds uncertainty. A future with robust economic growth could either worsen scarcity (more consumption) or provide means to solve it (more wealth to invest in solutions). Conversely, economic stagnation or collapse could reduce consumption (alleviating some pressures) but also cripple investment in tech and cooperation, perhaps making scarcity more acute for the vulnerable. Geopolitically, will we see more cooperation or conflict? In a cooperative scenario, countries might share technology, coordinate resource distribution, and assist each other in crises – uncertainty remains whether global institutions will strengthen or erode. If instead protectionism and rivalry dominate, resource-rich areas might cut others off, exacerbating shortages. The outbreak of new wars or persistent conflicts (perhaps driven by resource grabs) could drastically disrupt resource flows – an uncertainty that looms over optimistic supply projections (e.g., mineral supply assumes peace in mining regions, which may not hold).

- **Data and Measurement Gaps:** Our understanding of resource reserves and thresholds is incomplete. How much groundwater is truly left in major aquifers? Scientists have estimates, but often poor data – some aquifers could run dry sooner than anticipated. Similarly, estimates of mineral reserves keep evolving with new discoveries or reassessments; we might either find new deposits (extending supply) or realize certain resources are more limited than thought. There are also **tipping points** and feedbacks not fully understood – e.g., at what point does soil degradation irreversibly reduce agricultural yield? How close are we to collapsing major fisheries? Uncertainties in these scientific assessments lead to debates: some experts argue we have decades before certain peaks, others see them much sooner. Without better monitoring and data sharing (something WMO called for regarding water ([State of Global Water Resources 2023](https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-global-water-resources-2023#:~:text=Now%20in%20its%20third%20year%2C,6%20on%20water%20and%20sanitation))), we are partly “flying blind” into the future of resource availability.

- **Societal Adaptability:** How societies respond under stress is another unknown. Will scarcity lead more often to cooperation (neighbors sharing wells, nations signing peace treaties over water) or to competition and hoarding? History shows both are possible. Societies might innovate socially – e.g., new institutions for global resource governance, or cultural shifts toward conservation could emerge – but it’s uncertain where and how fast. Conversely, breakdown – state failure in places where scarcity and other issues overwhelm governance – is a real possibility, and predicting which countries might face that fate is difficult, hinging on leadership and social cohesion that are hard to quantify. Essentially, human resilience and adaptability – social, not just technological – is an uncertain factor that could greatly influence outcomes.

Experts often discuss these uncertainties through scenario analysis, examining best-case, worst-case, and middle-of-the-road futures (as the WEF did with its four “Resource Futures” scenarios ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Resource%20collaboration%20%E2%80%93%20the,Persistently%20high%20commodity)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Resource%20competition%20%E2%80%93%20the,most%20exposed%20to%20a%20concentration))). The consensus is that while we can project broad directions (increasing stress), the degree of severity is not predetermined – it will depend on how these uncertainties resolve. This makes planning difficult but also means proactive decisions now can steer us away from the most dire outcomes.

## Expert Consensus and Debate

**Consensus Areas:** There is a strong agreement among scientists, policy experts, and international bodies that resource scarcity poses a serious and escalating global risk. Organizations from the **United Nations** to the **World Economic Forum (WEF)** highlight natural resource crises as critical threats for the coming decade ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=of%20growing%20complexity%20and%20uncertainty%2C,a%20set%20of%20potential%20futures)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term)). Experts broadly concur that current consumption trends are unsustainable and that climate change is amplifying resource risks. There is near-universal recognition that urgent action is needed to improve resource efficiency, invest in sustainable technologies, and strengthen governance – essentially, the status quo will lead to dangerous outcomes. The framing of resource scarcity has shifted in recent years from a purely environmental or development issue to a **comprehensive security issue**, validating the systemic risk perspective. For example, security analysts and climate scientists agree that water and food insecurity can destabilize regions and act as catalysts for conflict, which in turn becomes a global security concern ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=reversal%20of%20recent%20progress,political%20upheaval%20and%20involuntary%20migration)) ([People facing acute food insecurity reach 345 million worldwide - WFP | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/people-facing-acute-food-insecurity-reach-340-million-worldwide-wfp-2022-08-24/#:~:text=,she%20said)). Another point of consensus is on the interdependence of resource issues: water, food, energy, and minerals are all linked (the “nexus” concept), and thus solutions must be integrated. The **expert community** also generally agrees on many of the drivers (population, climate, etc.) and the need for both supply-side and demand-side solutions.

In terms of risk levels, most experts describe resource scarcity in cautionary terms: phrases like “unprecedented pressure,” “alarming trends,” and “mounting crises” appear in key reports ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=world%20and%20has%20more%20than,doubled%20since%201960)) ([Extreme water stress faced by countries home to quarter of world population | Water | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/16/extreme-water-stress-faced-by-countries-home-to-quarter-of-world-population#:~:text=Globally%2C%20about%204%20billion%20people%2C,could%20be%20closer%20to%2060)). The IPCC’s latest reports explicitly state with high confidence that climate change has already reduced food and water security and will continue to do so ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=from%20floods%2C%20droughts%20and%20storms,food%20production%20from%20fisheries%20and)). The **WEF Global Risks Report 2023** includes “natural resource crises” among the top long-term risks and even maps out a potential polycrisis scenario centered on resource shortages ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=of%20growing%20complexity%20and%20uncertainty%2C,a%20set%20of%20potential%20futures)) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term)). This reflects a consensus that not only are resource issues severe on their own, but they are central knots in the web of global risks.

**Divergent Views:** While the gravity is agreed, experts diverge on **how catastrophic or how solvable** the problem is, and how to prioritize responses. Some analysts – often in the ecological economics or environmental NGO sphere – emphasize worst-case trajectories, warning of potential collapse if drastic changes are not made. They may point to models showing we are on track to greatly overshoot planetary limits (for water, nitrogen use, etc.) and advocate for urgent consumption cuts and systemic economic change (a shift away from growth-oriented models). On the other hand, **techno-optimists** and some economists argue that human innovation and markets will prevent outright collapse. They might note past doomsday predictions (like 1970s fears of running out of food or oil) were averted by new technology (Green Revolution, new oil finds) and believe similarly that renewable energy, desalination, and modern agriculture can support a large population if managed smartly. This camp is more confident that scarcity, while a challenge, is **manageable with incremental changes** and should not be overblown into apocalyptic terms.

There’s also debate on **which risks to prioritize**. For example, climate change versus direct resource management: some experts prioritize fighting climate change as the top way to secure resources (since failure there could dwarf other efforts), whereas others say immediate resource governance (like water sharing agreements, agricultural reform) needs equal attention because impacts are already happening regardless of climate trajectory. In food security circles, there’s debate over the role of global trade – some advocate self-sufficiency for vulnerable nations to reduce reliance on volatile markets, while others argue trade and open markets are crucial for efficiency and buffering local shocks. **Equity considerations** also generate debate: experts from developing countries often stress the disproportionate consumption of rich countries and seek global fairness in solutions (like technology transfer and climate finance), whereas experts from developed countries might focus on innovation and assume a trickle-down of benefits.

Another divergence is in **timeframe and severity**: Are we dealing with a looming near-term crisis or a slow-burn problem? Some point to current crises (Horn of Africa drought, western U.S. water shortages, etc.) as evidence the emergency is now, urging crisis footing and declaring a “planetary emergency.” Others view these as serious but localized, suggesting that globally we have a few decades to adjust course (in other words, a gradual tightening rather than an imminent crash).

**Risk Perception and Communication:** Interestingly, there’s also a difference in framing between disciplines – environmental scientists often highlight physical limits, while economists might highlight adaptive capacity and substitution. This affects how they communicate the risk: one might use the language of **scarcity and limits**, the other of **management and allocation**. Both agree resources are under pressure, but one might call it a fundamental crisis of sustainability, while another calls it an optimization problem we can solve with the right policies and tech.

In summary, experts agree that resource scarcity is a high-level risk that is complex and multi-faceted. The debate is less about **if** there’s a problem and more about **how big** it will get and **how best** to address it. There’s a spectrum from pessimism to optimism. Importantly, even the optimists generally do not dismiss the risk – they tend to instead emphasize human ability to respond. The consensus clearly is that actions are needed; the divergence lies in what actions are most critical (reducing demand vs. increasing supply, local self-reliance vs. global systems, immediate drastic cuts vs. phased transition, etc.) and how close we are to the brink. These debates underline the need for **foresight and flexible strategies** – given uncertainties, a mix of approaches (mitigate worst-case, strive for best-case) is prudent.

## Systemic Interactions with Other Global Risks

Resource scarcity does not occur in isolation – it is deeply **interconnected** with other major global risks, each mutually influencing the others. Two of the most prominent interactions are with **climate change** and **socio-political instability**, but the web extends further:

- **Climate Change:** This is a tightly coupled, two-way interaction. Climate change exacerbates resource scarcity by disturbing weather patterns (causing droughts, floods, heatwaves) that directly affect water availability and agricultural productivity ([AR6 Synthesis Report - Climate Change 2023 | Knowledge for policy](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-2023_en#:~:text=overall%20agricultural%20productivity%20has%20increased%2C,in%20extreme%20heat%20events%20have)). More frequent extreme weather leads to more crop failures and water crises, multiplying scarcity events. On the flip side, how we manage resources affects climate change: for example, deforestation for agriculture or fuel contributes to carbon emissions, and burning scarce fossil fuels obviously drives warming. There’s also the link via **mitigation efforts** – as the world shifts to renewable energy (to combat climate change), the demand for critical minerals surges, potentially creating new scarcities in the short term ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=between%20countries.,7)). If resource scarcity (say, a shortage of rare metals or water for cooling power plants) hampers climate mitigation or adaptation projects, it can form a vicious cycle. Essentially, failing to address climate change will worsen scarcity, and failing to secure resources will hinder climate action – a classic feedback loop between these risks.

- **Social Unrest and Conflict:** Scarcity of resources is a known trigger for social upheaval and even conflict, which in turn further disrupts resource access. For instance, **food and fuel riots** erupt when prices soar or supplies dwindle, as seen in various countries’ protests over bread or gasoline. These uprisings can destabilize governments (a societal risk) and lead to broader instability or civil conflict. In civil wars or regional conflicts, resource infrastructure (farms, water pipes, power grids) often gets destroyed or controlled by factions, magnifying scarcity for civilians. Moreover, conflict diverts public resources away from development to military needs, exacerbating poverty and future resource stress. At a geopolitical level, intense resource scarcity can inflame **interstate tensions** – e.g., competition over the Nile’s waters has created friction among countries, and disputes over water rights in Central Asia (for rivers emanating from the Himalayas) are a latent risk. There’s also the notion of **“weaponization” of resources**: states might restrict exports of critical resources to adversaries (as a geopolitical tool), which is both a result of conflict and a cause of economic risk. Thus, resource scarcity and instability can spiral together – scarcity breeds conflict, and conflict breeds deeper scarcity.

- **Economic Instability:** The health of the global economy is intertwined with resource availability. Scarcity can trigger **economic crises** – for example, oil supply shocks in the 1970s led to stagflation in many economies; similarly, the 2022 energy crunch and food price spike contributed to inflation reaching multi-decade highs worldwide ([Preface - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/#:~:text=compounding%20crises,inequality%20within%20and%20between%20countries)). Inflation erodes purchasing power and can induce recessions if central banks tighten policy aggressively to rein it in. Beyond inflation, actual physical shortages can cause recessions by stalling industrial production (no inputs, no outputs). If multiple resources become scarce together (say water and energy), the economic impacts could be severe and enduring, potentially causing a global downturn. Conversely, economic instability (like a financial crisis or depression) can worsen resource scarcity indirectly: if investment in infrastructure or agriculture dries up due to an economic crash, then resource production may lag and maintenance of existing systems falters. For instance, after the Soviet Union collapse, several agricultural and water management systems in Central Asia deteriorated, contributing to the Aral Sea crisis. Additionally, an unstable economy means governments and individuals have fewer means to adapt (can’t afford new tech or imports). Thus, resource and economic risks can reinforce each other in negative feedback.

- **Global Health Risks:** Resource scarcity can heighten global health threats. Malnutrition and lack of clean water make populations far more vulnerable to diseases and reduce their resilience to outbreaks. Weaker populations can turn what would be manageable outbreaks into severe crises. Scarcity-driven migration can spread diseases or create overcrowded refugee settings where epidemics breed. In turn, a major pandemic or health crisis can disrupt supply chains and labor for resource sectors (as COVID-19 did, impacting food harvesting, processing, and distribution), temporarily creating artificial scarcity. It can also divert government attention and funds away from resource management to emergency health measures. So, while at first glance health and resources are separate, under stress they clearly intersect.

- **Environmental Degradation and Biodiversity Loss:** This is closely linked with resource scarcity in both cause and effect. Over-exploitation of resources is a direct cause of biodiversity loss (e.g., overfishing and deforestation). Biodiversity loss in turn reduces ecosystem services that we rely on, effectively increasing resource scarcity (like the loss of pollinators affecting crop yields, or degraded ecosystems filtering less water). The risk of **ecosystem collapse** (one of the global environmental risks) is heightened by resource extraction – for example, if tropical forests collapse, regional rainfal patterns can shift, worsening water scarcity for people. So resource scarcity and biodiversity loss are mutually reinforcing risks within the environmental domain.

- **Technological Risks:** A more indirect interaction: if resource constraints are not addressed, they could spur **technological desperation** (rushing untested geoengineering or biotech solutions, for instance, which carry their own risks). Conversely, tech failures or cyber risks could hamper resource management (a cyberattack on an energy grid or water system could create an acute scarcity event). While not as obvious as climate or conflict, technology is part of the systemic picture – e.g. heavy reliance on a technology that requires scarce minerals could become a tech vulnerability.

- **Migration and Demographic Risks:** Large-scale migration due to resource scarcity (as mentioned, millions might be displaced by water stress) can cause demographic upheavals, urban overcrowding, and brain drains from certain areas. This ties into societal risks of integration, xenophobia, or state fragility when governments can’t handle influxes or exoduses. These social risks then loop back: a state under demographic stress might mismanage resources further, etc.

The systemic nature of resource scarcity means these interactions often form **feedback loops** – a shock in one domain can propagate and amplify through others, then circle back. Analysts increasingly use systems maps to illustrate this web. **For example, the figure below** (from WEF’s Global Risks Report 2023) depicts how “Natural resource crises” (center, green node) are interconnected with climate risks (green nodes), geopolitical risks (orange), economic risks (blue), and societal risks (red) ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term)). The thicker arrows indicate strong influence in both directions ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term)). It shows that failure to mitigate climate change, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather events all feed into resource crises, while resource crises can trigger interstate conflict, geoeconomic confrontations, and cost-of-living pressures ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term)).

([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/)) _Figure: The World Economic Forum’s “Natural resource polycrisis” network diagram illustrates the tight interlinkage between resource scarcity (green node) and other risks like climate change (green nodes), geopolitical conflict (orange), and societal crises such as cost-of-living pressures (red). Edges denote influence relationships as identified by risk experts ([3. Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures - Global Risks Report 2023 | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/in-full/3-resource-rivalries-four-emerging-futures/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20set%20of%20emerging,evolve%20over%20the%20medium%20term))._

In summary, **resource scarcity is a central node in the network of global risks**. Its alleviation can ease other risks, but if it worsens, it can act as a stress multiplier across the board. Effective risk management therefore requires a holistic view – tackling resource issues is part and parcel of tackling climate change, maintaining peace, ensuring economic stability, and protecting health and ecosystems. Analysts, policy makers, and resilience planners are increasingly adopting such a **systems approach**, understanding that building resilience to resource scarcity will reinforce resilience to many other global threats simultaneously.
