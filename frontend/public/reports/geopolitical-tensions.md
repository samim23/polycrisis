## Overview

Geopolitical tensions worldwide have surged to their highest levels in decades, encompassing military conflicts, cyberwarfare, economic confrontations, political instability, and diplomatic fractures. This risk is a core driver of the current _polycrisis_ – an intertwined set of global crises – because it exacerbates other challenges (like energy shocks, food insecurity, and climate action paralysis) while those challenges in turn fuel further tensions ([These are the biggest global risks we face in 2024 and beyond | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/#:~:text=A%20pessimistic%20global%20outlook)) ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=and%20normative%20contestation%20over%20principles,Russia%E2%80%99s%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine%2C%20on)). In essence, war and rivalry between states are undermining international cooperation at a time when collective resilience is most needed. The significance of this risk is profound: it threatens peace, economic stability, and sustainable development gains, increasing the likelihood of cascading crises that reinforce one another in dangerous feedback loops.

## Current Status

**Active Conflicts and Military Flashpoints:** The world is experiencing a proliferation of conflicts and brinkmanship not seen since the Cold War. There are currently 56 armed conflicts ongoing – the most since World War II – involving at least 92 states either directly or as external participants ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=Highest%20number%20of%20countries%20in,conflict%20since%20World%20War%20II)). Major wars are underway in Eastern Europe (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and the Middle East (e.g. renewed war in Gaza 2023), which together drove global battle-related deaths to about 162,000 in 2023 ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Conflicts%20in%20Gaza%20and,to%20conflict%20poses%20a%20significant)) ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=Last%20year%20recorded%20162%2C000%20conflict,the%20Rwandan%20genocide%20in%201994)) – the second-highest annual toll in 30 years. Great-power tensions are acute: NATO and Russia are effectively locked in a proxy war in Ukraine, and incidents like close encounters between U.S. and Chinese forces in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait occur with worrying frequency. Regional conflicts span the globe – from civil wars and insurgencies in the Sahel, Sudan, and Horn of Africa to enduring unrest in Syria and Yemen, and sporadic clashes in Asia (Myanmar’s civil conflict, Indo-Pakistani border skirmishes). This violence has created a humanitarian crisis of over **110 million people displaced** by conflict – a record high ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Militarisation%20recorded%20its%20largest,deterioration%2C%20driven%20by%20increases%20in)). Global military postures are on high alert, and nuclear rhetoric has escalated (e.g. Russian nuclear threats over Ukraine), putting the world in a state of heightened military readiness and anxiety.

**Cyberwarfare and Hybrid Conflict:** Hostile cyber activities by state and state-sponsored actors have spiked alongside kinetic conflicts. In 2024, Russian cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure surged by nearly **70%**, with over 4,300 incidents targeting government and energy systems ([Significant Cyber Incidents | Strategic Technologies Program | CSIS](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents#:~:text=January%202025%3A%20Russian%20cyberattacks%20on,distribution%2C%20phishing%2C%20and%20account%20compromises)). Similarly, Chinese cyber incursions against Taiwan doubled, reaching an astonishing **2.4 million attempted attacks per day** on Taiwanese government networks ([Significant Cyber Incidents | Strategic Technologies Program | CSIS](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents#:~:text=account%20compromises)). Critical infrastructure in many countries – from North America to Europe and Asia – faces relentless cyber intrusion attempts linked to geopolitical disputes. For example, Western governments have reported waves of hacks attributed to foreign intelligence services (such as the 2023 breach of U.S. government email systems, blamed on Chinese actors). Cyberwarfare has become a constant, low-level battleground: even when armies are not firing, nation-states are engaged in espionage, sabotage, and influence operations online. This blurs the line between war and peace and poses a threat of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” scenario where digital attacks could trigger wider crises. The current condition is one of _persistent cyber conflict_, where nearly every international dispute – from elections to territorial disagreements – has a cyber dimension. Notably, 91% of cybersecurity leaders believe that geopolitical instability makes a major cyber incident likely in the near-term ([2023 was a big year for cybercrime – here’s how we can make our systems safer | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/cybersecurity-cybercrime-system-safety/#:~:text=This%20article%20is%20part%20of%3A,World%20Economic%20Forum%20Annual%20Meeting)) ([2023 was a big year for cybercrime – here’s how we can make our systems safer | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/cybersecurity-cybercrime-system-safety/#:~:text=Cybercrime%20is%20a%20real%20and,in%20the%20next%20two%20years)).

**Economic and Trade Confrontations:** Geopolitical rivalry is playing out in the economic arena as a form of “geoeconomic warfare.” Trade restrictions, sanctions, and investment barriers have multiplied in recent years. The IMF reports that **new trade barriers introduced annually have nearly tripled since 2019**, rising to roughly 3,000 in 2022 ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=essay%20www)). The U.S.–China trade and tech conflict remains intense: the U.S. has imposed sweeping export controls on advanced semiconductors and telecom equipment to China, while China has retaliated with its own bans and a drive for self-sufficiency. Global foreign direct investment flows are increasingly influenced by geopolitical alignment rather than market logic ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=Other%20forms%20of%20fragmentation%E2%80%94like%20technological,direct%20investment%20and%20portfolio%20flows)) – for instance, “friend-shoring” of supply chains to politically allied countries is underway. Sanctions are a key tool: comprehensive sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war have isolated Russia’s economy (e.g. cutting it off from Western finance and technology), and secondary sanctions threaten countries that aid Russia. Energy trade has been weaponized; Russia’s cutoff of gas to Europe in 2022 forced Europe to scramble for alternative suppliers, while Western allies imposed price caps on Russian oil. The current global trade system is thus under strain, with the World Trade Organization’s rules-based framework weakened by great power actions (the WTO dispute appellate body remains defunct due to U.S. objections). All of this has injected uncertainty into markets – evidenced by volatile energy and commodity prices – and contributed to a slowdown in globalization. Businesses face elevated political risk premiums, and many are diversifying operations to hedge against geopolitical shocks. **Geoeconomic confrontation** has therefore become a constant feature of the international landscape, threatening to fragment the global economy into rival blocs ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=While%20estimates%20of%20the%20cost,Saharan%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20annual%20output)).

**Political Instability and Domestic Turmoil:** Internal political instability in numerous countries is both a symptom and a source of geopolitical tension. The world has witnessed a wave of coups and unconstitutional power grabs, particularly in parts of Africa – at least **6 coups since 2021** in the Sahel and West Africa (Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Niger, Gabon), often installing military regimes that pivot away from Western partnerships and towards new alliances. Civil unrest is widespread: issues like the cost-of-living crisis, corruption, and ethnic grievances have sparked mass protests (from Latin America to Asia), at times resulting in violent crackdowns or state failure. Democratic backsliding is notable – 2023 marked the 17th consecutive year of global democratic decline (per Freedom House data), reflecting growing authoritarianism and polarization. Major democracies are not immune: the United States, for example, remains deeply polarized after the January 2021 Capitol riot, and in Brazil, protesters stormed government buildings in January 2023 over disputed election results. Such polarization can hamper coherent foreign policy and is exploited by adversaries through disinformation ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Emerging%20as%20the%20most%20severe,to%20civil%20confrontation%20and%20terrorism)). In many regions, fragile states are becoming proxy battlegrounds for larger powers (e.g. Libya’s chaos draws in multiple external players). **The current status is one of elevated political volatility**, where internal conflicts (civil wars in Ethiopia, Myanmar, etc.) and governance crises (economic collapse in Sri Lanka, Lebanon’s paralysis) often have cross-border impacts – whether by creating safe havens for extremists, triggering refugee flows, or inviting foreign intervention. This fragility within states feeds the broader geopolitical risk environment by providing flashpoints and opportunities for great-power contest.

**Diplomatic Fractures and Eroding Multilateral Order:** Diplomatic relations among major players are strained, and global governance is “gridlocked.” The UN Security Council is frequently paralyzed – for instance, any resolution to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine gets vetoed by Russia, while U.S. vetoes (and threats thereof) stymie action on issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict. The G20, traditionally a forum bridging East and West, struggled to reach consensus in 2023: at one ministerial, participants failed to agree on a joint communiqué for the first time, prompting India’s foreign minister to lament that “multilateralism is in crisis” ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=dividing%20our%20world%20run%20along,United%20States%20and%20China%2C%20two)). Rival diplomatic groupings have gained prominence: examples include the BRICS bloc (which in 2024 added new members like Saudi Arabia and Iran) positioning itself as a counterweight to G7 influence, and minilateral security partnerships (AUKUS, the Quad) forming outside traditional institutions. Trust between the Global North and South has frayed – many developing nations feel their concerns (development finance, climate adaptation) are sidelined, while wealthy nations feel some emerging powers are aligning with revisionist states. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned, the world’s inability to come together has left it “**gridlocked in global dysfunction**” ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=and%20normative%20contestation%20over%20principles,Russia%E2%80%99s%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine%2C%20on)). Diplomatically, this means mediation in conflicts is harder to achieve, and global agreements (on climate, arms control, health, etc.) are exceedingly difficult to finalize. Even longstanding alliances face occasional rifts (e.g. disagreements within NATO or the EU on strategy, Turkey’s balancing act between NATO and Russia). The current diplomatic landscape is characterized by **fragmentation**: numerous bilateral or regional deals occur (such as the China-brokered normalization between Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023), but a coherent global approach is lacking. International law and norms are being eroded by blatant violations (territorial aggression, chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that go unsanctioned due to great power impunity. In summary, cooperative mechanisms are weakest at the moment when geopolitical strains are strongest, creating a precarious global status quo.

## Trends and Projections

**Recent Trend – Rising Tensions After a Post-Cold War Lull:** Geopolitical tensions have markedly **escalated over the past decade**. After the 1990s and early 2000s saw a general decline in interstate wars and a period of U.S.-led unipolar stability, around the mid-2010s the trend reversed. World military expenditure has increased for nine consecutive years (2014 through 2023) ([Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 | SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2024/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2023#:~:text=World%20military%20expenditure%20increased%20for,highest%20since%201990%2C%20at%20%24306)), reaching an all-time high (over $2.44 trillion in 2023) driven largely by confrontation and conflict ([Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 | SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2024/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2023#:~:text=World%20military%20expenditure%20increased%20for,highest%20since%201990%2C%20at%20%24306)) ([Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 | SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2024/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2023#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20global%20military,Oceania%20and%20the%20Middle%20East)). The Global Peace Index has recorded year-on-year deteriorations in global peacefulness for much of the last decade; notably, **97 countries became less peaceful in 2023**, the worst decline on record ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=Key%20results)). Key inflection points include Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 (ushering in a renewed East-West standoff), the Syrian civil war and other Arab Spring conflicts in the 2010s (which internationalized regional rivalries), and the rapid rise of China’s economic and military power. By 2020, great-power competition was firmly back: the U.S. characterized China and Russia as strategic competitors, and those nations started collaborating more closely with each other to counter U.S. influence. The trend accelerated with major events like the full-scale Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and the intensification of U.S.-China technology and trade disputes. **Global conflict fatalities, after a relative low around 2010, have surged** (the year 2023 had the highest conflict death toll since the early 1990s Balkans/Rwanda era) ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=Last%20year%20recorded%20162%2C000%20conflict,the%20Rwandan%20genocide%20in%201994)). Likewise, the number of **proxy wars and interventions** has grown – regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and others have been more assertive in pursuing their interests via local conflicts. Another trend is the normalization of _hybrid warfare_ tactics (cyber attacks, disinformation, economic coercion) as everyday tools of statecraft. Overall, the past few years depict a clear trajectory of a world shifting from cooperation to competition, with multiple overlapping crises (pandemic, economic shocks) feeding mistrust among nations. The **polycrisis environment** – where conflicts, economic stress, and climate disasters interplay – appears to be reinforcing geopolitical friction in a vicious cycle.

**Short-Term Outlook (next 1–3 years):** The near-term risk of conflicts and confrontations remains **high and dynamic**. Experts broadly anticipate that current hot wars could _persist or even escalate_ before they abate. In its 2024 Global Risks Report, the World Economic Forum ranked “interstate conflict” as a top risk over a 2-year horizon, re-entering the highest-risk category ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Simmering%20geopolitical%20tensions%20combined%20with,will%20drive%20new%20security%20risks)). The war in Ukraine is projected to grind on into 2024 absent a diplomatic breakthrough, with the constant danger of escalation – such as direct clashes between NATO and Russian forces (e.g., an incident spilling into NATO territory) or Russia’s potential use of more devastating weapons. Other frozen conflicts carry the threat of flaring up: for example, **tensions over Taiwan** are expected to intensify in the short term as Chinese military pressure grows and U.S. support for Taiwan increases, raising the possibility of a crisis or miscalculation in the next few years. In the Middle East, after the Israel–Hamas war of 2023, the region sits on a knife’s edge – an uneasy ceasefire or low-level conflict could be punctured by new violence involving Lebanon (Hezbollah) or Iran, which could quickly regionalize any renewed war. South Asia remains a potential flashpoint too (the India–Pakistan conflict, while currently subdued, could be reignited by a terrorist attack or political shift, especially with both countries heading into elections). Moreover, the short-term may see **spillover “conflict contagion”** ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=As%20both%20a%20product%20and,threats%20or%20growing%20state%20fragility)): as major powers are preoccupied, opportunistic moves elsewhere become more likely (e.g., Azerbaijan’s move to take Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023 occurred while Russia was bogged down in Ukraine). Analysts also warn of the risk of _new theaters of proxy conflict_: for instance, unrest in the **Sahel region** (with multiple juntas) has created a playground for Russian Wagner mercenaries and could lead to standoffs between Western and Russian interests in Africa. On the economic front, short-term projections suggest geoeconomic fragmentation will deepen – we may see more tit-for-tat sanctions (such as Western restrictions on outbound investment to China, and Chinese export bans on critical minerals). This could provoke further volatility in energy and commodity markets if conflicts or sanctions disrupt supply lines. A World Bank analysis shows an escalation of conflict in critical regions (like a wider Middle East war) could send oil prices skyrocketing by 30% above baseline, harming global growth ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20tensions%20have%20become%20the,of%20global%20container%20traffic)) ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20tensions%20heighten%20uncertainty%2C%20which,B)). In sum, the next couple of years are likely to be marked by **ongoing crises** (protracted wars) and a heightened risk of **new flashpoints** emerging, against a backdrop of strained great-power relations. The consensus is pessimistic: 84% of global experts surveyed see the short-term outlook as negative or volatile ([The Global Risks Report 2024 - 19th Edition | Zurich Insurance](https://www.zurich.com/knowledge/topics/global-risks/the-global-risks-report-2024#:~:text=As%20we%20enter%202024%2C%202023,are%20pessimistic)).

**Long-Term Outlook (to 2030 and beyond):** Structurally, the world appears headed into a period of **multipolar fragmentation** that could last through the decade. Two-thirds of surveyed global risk experts anticipate a multipolar or fragmented world order by 2030, characterized by multiple great and regional powers each setting rules in their spheres ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Asked%20about%20the%20global%20political,military%2C%20technological%20and%20economic%20terms)). This implies that competition – rather than a single hegemonic peace or a cooperative global governance – will be the norm. Over the longer term, several trends could shape geopolitical risk:

- **Power Transitions and Arms Racing:** China’s continued rise (economically and militarily) and the U.S.’s determination to maintain primacy suggest that strategic rivalry will deepen. By the late 2020s, China is expected to close the gap in areas like naval power and could be more confident in challenging the status quo in Asia. The U.S. and allies will likely accelerate defense build-ups (Japan, for example, is already doubling its defense budget by 2027). Other powers (India, a resurgent post-war Ukraine or emboldened Russia, etc.) will also seek greater military capabilities. Absent new arms control treaties, we could see a **renewed nuclear arms race** – the New START treaty (limiting U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals) expires in 2026, and if not extended or replaced, for the first time in decades there would be _no binding limits_ on the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals. That, combined with China potentially doubling or tripling its nuclear stockpile by 2030, may increase the risk of miscalculation or proliferation. Advanced weaponry like hypersonic missiles and AI-enabled drones will be more widely deployed, potentially destabilizing deterrence by reducing decision times ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=The%20growing%20internationalization%20of%20conflicts,escalation%20over%20the%20next%20decade)).

- **Persistent Conflicts and New Ones:** Many current conflicts could become protracted “frozen” conflicts (e.g. a low-intensity but unresolved war in Eastern Ukraine, or a simmering Israel–Palestine struggle with intermittent flare-ups). At the same time, **resource pressures and nationalist ambitions** could spark new conflicts. In the long term, climate change is a critical wildcard – by exacerbating water and food scarcity, it may ignite disputes especially in parts of Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. For instance, competition over the Nile or Indus waters could worsen. The Arctic might become a domain of rivalry as melting ice opens new routes and resource fields. Looking to East Asia, if China’s internal trajectory is stable, it might continue a patient strategy on Taiwan; if not, the late 2020s could be a period of maximum risk for a forceful move on Taiwan. U.S. war-gaming often cites the mid-2020s to early 2030s as a window of heightened danger in the Indo-Pacific. Thus, **structural tensions (US–China, NATO–Russia)** are likely to remain unresolved and periodically acute.

- **Geoeconomic Blocs and Fragmentation:** Economically, projections warn of a fragmented trade and tech landscape. By 2030, the world could split into semi-decoupled blocs (a U.S.-led bloc and a China-led bloc, with other countries navigating in between). The IMF estimates that severe geoeconomic fragmentation (in trade, technology, capital flows) could shave **up to 7% off global GDP in the long run** ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=While%20estimates%20of%20the%20cost,Saharan%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20annual%20output)) – essentially, a less efficient global economy with duplicated supply chains and less diffusion of innovation. This economic cost could itself breed further political resentment and zero-sum thinking, entrenching rivalry. Some positive long-term scenario would involve partial reconvergence – for example, if the U.S. and China manage to establish “guardrails” for competition and cooperate on shared challenges, easing the worst pressures. But as of now, most signals point to continued divergence, with the Belt and Road Initiative, new development banks, and currency arrangements reducing interdependence between East and West.

- **Structural Instabilities:** Long-term structural issues, like demographic shifts (aging in some powers, youth bulges in others) and resource depletion, may stress nations internally and lead to more **political instability** that spills outward. For instance, countries in the Sahel with rapidly growing populations and climate stress could remain hotbeds of conflict through the 2020s. Technology proliferation means smaller states and even non-state actors might gain capabilities (like cyber tools or drones) that let them challenge bigger powers or at least cause disruption – a trend that could democratize conflict but also make it more unpredictable.

In terms of **foresight**, many analysts compare the coming era to the late 19th-century multipolar period or the Cold War, but with modern twists (like cyber domains). Some believe a _stable multipolar equilibrium_ might eventually emerge by the 2030s if powers learn to coexist with clear spheres of influence. Others fear a _systemic crisis_ if multiple flashpoints converge (for example, simultaneous conflicts or a major power war). A notable warning sign: the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’ **Doomsday Clock** – a synthetic indicator of existential risk – is currently set at _90 seconds to midnight_, the closest ever, reflecting experts’ view that the world is at unprecedented peril due in large part to the Ukraine war and nuclear risks ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20living%20in%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=The%20Doomsday%20Clock%20statement%20explains,Efforts%20by)). If geopolitical tensions remain unmanaged, by the late 2020s the risk of a catastrophic event (nuclear exchange, global war) – however still unlikely in absolute terms – would be the highest it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, according to veteran strategists. In summary, the long-term structural trajectory is toward **sustained high geopolitical risk**; whether it plateaus in a managed competition or escalates into systemic conflict will depend on how leaders and institutions respond in the coming few years.

## Key Drivers and Mechanisms

Several interlocking drivers underlie the rise in geopolitical tensions, accelerating the risk. These drivers create mechanisms that can either propel conflicts forward or, if mitigated, slow the descent into crises:

- **Great Power Rivalry and Power Transition:** The most fundamental driver is the return of great power competition. The relative decline of a unipolar U.S.-led order and the emergence of new power centers (China’s ascent, a revanchist Russia, an increasingly assertive India, etc.) have led to a contest over the rules of the international system. This manifests in arms buildups, sphere-of-influence carving, and diplomatic tussles. A key mechanism here is the _security dilemma_: one power’s defensive military expansion is seen as offensive by another, prompting an arms race. For example, NATO’s expansion in Eastern Europe (justified by member states’ security needs) was viewed as a threat by Russia, which drove Russia to militarize and eventually strike out (as in Ukraine) ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=The%20current%20disorder%20has%20multiple,emerging%20nations%20with%20diverse%20preferences)) ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=intensifying%20strategic%20competition%20between%20the,accommodate%20them%3B%20a%20widespread%20retreat)). Similarly, China’s military modernization and territorial claims have spurred regional neighbors and the U.S. to bolster defenses, which Beijing then cites as encirclement. This feedback loop of mistrust feeds escalating preparations for conflict.

- **Ideological and Nationalist Resurgence:** Geopolitics is not just about raw power; clashing ideologies and nationalism also fuel tensions. In recent years there’s been a surge of nationalist leadership and rhetoric – from “America First” in the U.S. to assertive nationalism in China, India, Turkey, and elsewhere. These ideologies often frame international relations as zero-sum and paint other countries as adversaries, which hardens diplomatic positions. Authoritarian powers promote a narrative of resisting Western liberal hegemony, while Western countries cast the struggle as one between democracy and autocracy. Such framing can make compromises harder. Domestic politics play a role: embattled leaders may use foreign confrontations to rally national unity or distract from problems at home (the classic “rally ’round the flag” effect). This driver is evident in how public opinion is mobilized – for instance, **state-sponsored disinformation** campaigns and patriotic media messaging deepen citizens’ hostility toward rival nations ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Emerging%20as%20the%20most%20severe,violent%20protests%20and%20hate%20crimes)). _Mechanism:_ Ideological differences can lead to the formation of opposing blocs (e.g. democracies vs authoritarian states), reduced communication, and moral justifications for war (each side sees the other as “evil” or illegitimate).

- **Erosion of International Norms and Institutions:** The guardrails that traditionally kept geopolitical competition in check have been eroding. Key arms control agreements have lapsed (the INF Treaty ended in 2019; the Open Skies Treaty in 2020; New START is hanging by a thread). Norms like respect for sovereignty were shattered by actions such as Russia’s annexation of territory by force ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=The%20Doomsday%20Clock%20statement%20explains,Efforts%20by)), Syria’s use of chemical weapons, etc. Institutions like the UN Security Council have been unable to enforce rules when great powers are involved, leading to a sense of impunity. As norms weaken, deterrence shifts from legal/political constraints to purely military ones, raising risks. _Mechanism:_ Without agreed rules, states resort to unilateral action – e.g., preemptive strikes, annexations, cyberattacks – calculating only raw power outcomes. This creates instability because miscalculations or aggressive moves are more likely when there’s no shared understanding of red lines. The failure of collective security – evident when veto-wielding powers block UN action – means regional security dilemmas worsen (countries feel they must arm themselves or seek powerful patrons). In sum, the “rules-based international order” is fraying, encouraging more frequent and brazen challenges by dissatisfied states.

- **Resource Competition and Economic Pressures:** Fundamental needs for energy, minerals, and economic security drive state behavior. Oil and gas geopolitics remain a flashpoint – control over energy transit routes and supplies has been behind conflicts and power plays (Russia’s gas influence in Europe, disputes in the South China Sea partly due to potential oil/gas reserves, Gulf rivalries, etc.). As the world slowly transitions to clean energy, new resource competition is emerging for critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, rare earths), often located in geopolitically sensitive areas. Water scarcity is another looming driver – regions like the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia face acute water stress that could pit countries against each other (e.g., Ethiopia vs Egypt over the Nile). Additionally, **economic stress** (inflation, inequality, debt crises) can destabilize countries internally and make them more belligerent externally or more susceptible to outside interference. A mechanism here is **geoeconomic coercion**: powerful states leveraging trade and finance (sanctions, export controls) to pressure rivals, which then retaliate, creating a spiral that intertwines with security issues. For instance, U.S.-China trade tensions partly stem from China’s mercantilist practices and U.S. efforts to retain tech dominance; each tariff or tech ban begets a countermeasure, feeding strategic decoupling ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=essay%20www)). Economic interdependence, once thought to be a peace factor, is now being weaponized (“weaponized interdependence”), altering the risk calculus. Countries are also driven by the need for economic growth to maintain legitimacy; when growth falters, leaders may externalize blame or seek nationalist economic policies, undermining cooperation further.

- **Technological Advancement and Arms Race in New Domains:** Rapid advances in technology are creating new theatres for competition – notably cyberspace, space, and artificial intelligence. Cyberspace offers a relatively low-cost, deniable means to project power (hacking, cyber espionage, attacks on infrastructure), which many states are now exploiting daily. The development of offensive cyber units and AI-driven cyber tools accelerates the frequency and scale of incidents (we’ve seen power grid hacks, ransomware attacks on pipelines, etc., often linked to rival states). _Mechanism:_ Cyberattacks can act as both a precursor to physical conflict (softening targets) and as standalone coercion; they also carry a risk of escalation if critical services are hit (consider if a cyberattack causes a blackout or pipeline explosion – it could be seen as an act of war). In outer space, the weaponization (anti-satellite missile tests by Russia, China, India) creates debris and threatens vital satellite networks, potentially blinding militaries in a crisis. On AI, as the WEF noted, integration of AI into military decision-making could **condense decision times and blur human control**, raising the odds of accidental war ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=The%20growing%20internationalization%20of%20conflicts,escalation%20over%20the%20next%20decade)). Hypersonic missiles (developed by China, Russia, U.S.) reduce warning times for attack, straining existing early-warning systems. The _lack of agreed rules_ for these frontier technologies (no cyber treaty, no space arms control update, nascent AI ethics frameworks) means a wild-west dynamic is in play. Each technological breakthrough by one side spurs the others to catch up – a classic arms race pattern now unfolding on multiple fronts (digital, nuclear modernization, aerospace). This driver is accelerating the pace at which conflicts could unfold and enabling new actors to become threats (a small state or even a well-resourced non-state actor could wield cyber weapons or drones effectively). Technology also amplifies propaganda and misinformation, which can inflame tensions and make diplomatic resolution harder by manipulating public perception ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Emerging%20as%20the%20most%20severe,to%20civil%20confrontation%20and%20terrorism)).

- **Alliance Dynamics and Regional Power Shifts:** Long-standing alliances (e.g., NATO, U.S.-Japan, Russia-China “partnership”) and emerging coalitions shape risk by deterring some conflicts but aggravating others. When defensive alliances expand or strengthen, adversaries may feel encircled (as Russia did with NATO, or China with the Quad/AUKUS) and respond aggressively. Conversely, if alliances weaken, it could embolden opportunistic aggression (some argue the perceived weakening of Western unity in late 2010s perhaps tempted revisionist moves). Regional organizations and power vacuums also drive outcomes: the Middle East saw new alliances like the Abraham Accords (Israel-Arab) which shift traditional enmities, while African and Latin American regional bodies often struggle to mediate conflicts without major power backing. _Mechanism:_ Alliances can act as **force multipliers** (many nations vs one in a conflict, raising stakes) and create a domino effect – a crisis involving one can draw in many due to treaty obligations. They also foster proxy competitions in third countries as rivals try to prevent losing influence. The expansion of NATO to Russia’s border or China’s courting of Pacific Island nations illustrate how alliance moves trigger countermoves, tightening the strategic web. Non-state networks (transnational extremist or criminal networks) also tie into geopolitics, as states sometimes patronize these proxies (Iran with various militias, Russia allegedly with private military companies) to pursue goals indirectly, which perpetuates conflicts.

- **Mitigating Factors (or lack thereof):** In theory, some drivers could mitigate tensions: nuclear deterrence remains a major factor preventing direct great power war – the fear of mutually assured destruction has restrained what might otherwise have been open conflict (e.g., the U.S. and Russia have avoided direct clashes in Ukraine partly due to the nuclear overhang). Economic interdependence, while strained, still creates some common interest in stability (for instance, China’s integration in global trade gives it incentive to avoid a disastrous war that would wreck markets). International diplomacy, when effective, can slow arms races or resolve specific issues (recent examples include the extension of a truce in Yemen, or the Indonesia-mediated de-escalation between China and ASEAN claimants in the South China Sea). However, these mitigating factors are weakening – arms control treaties are expiring, and economic decoupling is reducing the peace-through-trade effect. Thus, the balance of drivers currently tilts toward those _accelerating_ risk rather than restraining it.

In summary, a confluence of **power shifts, clashing ideologies, broken norms, resource rivalries, technological arms races, and polarized alliances** is propelling the world into a period of heightened geopolitical danger. Each driver reinforces the others – e.g., resource competition feeds nationalist fervor; tech arms races exacerbate great power rivalry – creating a self-reinforcing cycle of tension. Unless counteracted by strong diplomatic and institutional interventions, these drivers suggest a structural propensity toward further conflict.

## Impacts and Cascading Effects

Geopolitical tensions have wide-ranging impacts that extend far beyond the warring parties, often triggering secondary crises and feedback loops across global systems.

**Humanitarian and Social Impacts:** The most direct impact is the human cost – armed conflicts have killed hundreds of thousands in recent years and displaced millions. As noted, violence has driven **110 million people** from their homes globally ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Militarisation%20recorded%20its%20largest,deterioration%2C%20driven%20by%20increases%20in)), straining humanitarian aid systems and host countries. Prolonged conflicts (Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Ukraine, etc.) have caused long-term societal trauma, a “lost generation” of youth out of school, and regional destabilization due to refugee flows. For example, the Syrian war’s refugee exodus into neighboring countries and Europe not only created a humanitarian challenge but also stirred political backlash and xenophobic movements in those host nations. These social strains can in turn fuel further instability: refugees in distress can be recruited by extremist groups, or their presence can spark interstate tensions (as seen when Turkey at times leveraged the threat of refugee influx towards the EU). Within conflict zones, breakdown of governance leads to _lawlessness_, criminality, and the spread of arms – problems that can seep across borders (the Sahel’s instability has allowed terrorism and arms to spread to coastal West Africa).

**Economic and Global Supply Chain Impacts:** Geopolitical strife often disrupts trade and critical supply chains, causing global economic ripples. The Russia-Ukraine war is a prime example: Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of grains, fertilizer, and energy. The war and related sanctions led to **global food prices spiking to near-record highs in 2022**, contributing to food insecurity in Africa and the Middle East. It also triggered a European energy crisis as gas flows from Russia plummeted, forcing costly energy substitutions that fueled inflation. Conflict in the Middle East similarly threatens oil markets – during flare-ups, oil prices factor in a risk premium. Analysis shows that a major escalation in the Middle East conflict could push oil well above baseline projections, stoking worldwide inflation and shaving points off global GDP ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20tensions%20have%20become%20the,of%20global%20container%20traffic)) ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20tensions%20heighten%20uncertainty%2C%20which,B)). Even outside active war zones, **geopolitical confrontations dampen economic confidence**: businesses delay investments due to uncertainty, insurance costs for operating in conflict-prone regions rise, and defense spending diverts resources from productive investment. According to the Institute for Economics & Peace, the global economic impact of violence reached **$19.1 trillion in 2023 (13.5% of world GDP)** ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20First%20of%20its%20kind,than%20half%20a%20million%20refugees)) ([Highest number of countries engaged in conflict since World War II](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/highest-number-of-countries-engaged-in-conflict-since-world-war-ii/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20global%20economic%20impact,deterioration%2C%20driven%20by%20increases%20in)) – this encompasses the direct costs of conflict, refugees, homicides, etc., as well as the opportunity costs. That figure has been climbing, indicating how violence and tension act as a massive “tax” on the world economy. A particularly worrying cascade is the feedback between sanctions and the global financial system: for instance, sanctions on Russia led it to deepen non-dollar trade and develop alternatives (like a SWIFT alternative with China). Over time, the bifurcation of finance could reduce market liquidity and efficiency, raising borrowing costs especially for developing nations caught between blocs.

**Impact on Global Governance and Cooperation:** High geopolitical tensions erode trust among nations, directly undermining the ability to collaboratively tackle other global challenges. We see a spillover effect in climate action – geopolitical rifts have slowed climate cooperation (e.g., G20 environment meetings failing to agree on targets when broader relations are bad). Military conflicts also produce significant carbon emissions and environmental damage (oil facilities on fire, military-industrial output), indirectly worsening climate change. Conversely, climate-driven disasters demand a coordinated response, but if major powers are at odds, the humanitarian response is politicized or insufficient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, U.S.-China animosity led to initial delays in information sharing and later manifested in a vaccine diplomacy competition rather than a unified strategy. The net effect is that global crises compound: **geopolitical rivalry makes solving shared problems harder**, which then exacerbates those problems and can circle back to fuel more rivalry (a true vicious cycle). A concrete case: the war in Ukraine has monopolized diplomatic attention and resources in the UN and among donor countries, arguably detracting focus from other conflicts (Ethiopia, Myanmar) and development needs, which if left unaddressed can become new security threats. Another cascading effect is institutional weakening – countries have been withdrawing from or defunding multilateral institutions in part due to rivalries (e.g., the U.S. and then China trading withdrawals from UN agencies under the previous U.S. administration). Over time, this could hollow out the conflict-resolution and norm-setting capacity of the international community, making future disputes harder to contain.

**Cascading Security Effects (Conflict Spillovers):** Geopolitical conflicts often have a contagion effect. A local conflict can attract interventions from multiple foreign powers, essentially “internationalizing” it. In such proxy wars – Syria and Libya being examples – the complexity and duration of conflict increase, and the risk of accidental clashes between foreign powers’ forces rises (e.g., U.S. and Russian forces operated in proximity in Syria, requiring de-confliction hotlines to avoid incidents). There’s also the phenomenon of **emulation** or chain reaction: one successful aggression might embolden similar moves elsewhere. After Azerbaijan’s use of force in 2020 and 2023 to resolve its conflicts, other states might take note that revisions by force can succeed. Likewise, if a major power gains by breaching norms, others might follow (the concern that a Russia win in Ukraine could encourage China on Taiwan, for instance). Conflict-driven state collapse can create ungoverned spaces that become breeding grounds for terrorism and transnational crime (the rise of ISIS from the chaos of Iraq/Syria, or Sahel insurgencies expanding due to Libya’s collapse). Those threats then spread globally in the form of terrorist attacks or drug trafficking, pulling new countries into security responses. The **nuclear proliferation cascade** is another dire possibility: regional tensions (Iran feeling threatened, or East Asian states worried about North Korea and China) could motivate more countries to seek nuclear weapons if they lose faith in global security guarantees, leading to a far more dangerous world.

**Feedback Loops and the Polycrisis:** Crucially, geopolitical tensions interact with other risks in feedback loops. One salient loop is with economic distress: war and tensions fuel inflation and recession risks (e.g., Europe’s inflation spiked due to war-induced energy costs), and economic crises in turn breed political extremism and scapegoating that further heighten geopolitical frictions. Another loop is with **misinformation and societal discord**: during high tensions, state-sponsored propaganda and hacking increase, which can destabilize democracies internally ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Emerging%20as%20the%20most%20severe,to%20civil%20confrontation%20and%20terrorism)); unstable or polarized societies are less able to have consistent foreign policies or may elect hardline leaders, amplifying international hostility. Climate change is often termed a “threat multiplier” for conflict – we are seeing that in real time with droughts and resource scarcities contributing to conflicts in the Sahel and Middle East. Conversely, the focus on immediate conflicts has delayed climate mitigation efforts, meaning worse climate impacts ahead (e.g., countries burning more coal when gas became scarce). In a polycrisis scenario, these risks (conflict, climate, economic, health) don’t just coincide – they amplify one another. A war can cause an energy shock that undermines climate goals and economies, which fosters political turmoil that can lead to more conflicts or less cooperation on health, and so on. Decision-makers today face the challenge that **geopolitical instability can set off a chain reaction** across domains, and once multiple crises are in motion, they reinforce the sense of insecurity globally. This can even push normally cautious actors into more aggressive stances (every nation for itself mentality). On the positive side, severe cascading effects sometimes shock leaders into cooperation – for example, the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022 saw adversaries broker a deal to avert famine. But such cooperative breaks are fragile and often short-lived.

In essence, the impacts of geopolitical tensions are **truly global and multi-dimensional**: from human lives lost to trillions in economic damage, from undermining institutions to triggering secondary disasters. And because these effects feed back into the geopolitical sphere (via instability, grievances, or resource shifts), the world faces a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. Understanding these cascading impacts is critical for resilience planning – it’s not just about conflict prevention, but also buffering societies and systems against the shocks that geopolitical strife will cause.

## Geographic Variations

The character and intensity of geopolitical tensions vary across different regions, with each region having its own flashpoints and dynamics:

- **Europe (especially Eastern Europe):** Europe’s security environment dramatically worsened with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Eastern Europe is now the site of a high-intensity interstate war – something the continent hadn’t seen since the mid-20th century. NATO has bolstered its eastern flank, and countries like Poland and the Baltics are on guard, given direct Russian threats. The war has also revived transatlantic unity (NATO is more cohesive, with Finland joining in 2023 and Sweden likely to follow) and increased defense spending across Europe. However, it has deepened the rift between Russia and the West into a long-term confrontation. Other parts of Europe remain largely peaceful, but latent tensions persist in the Balkans (Serbia-Kosovo disputes, Bosnia’s political fragility) and the Caucasus (Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, where Russia’s influence waned allowing Azerbaijan’s military solution in 2023). Europe also feels geopolitical stress from **energy dependence** – while it has reduced reliance on Russia, it remains exposed to global energy market swings and is now courting suppliers like the US, Gulf states, and Africa (which introduces new strategic considerations). Another dimension is Europe’s neighborhood instability: conflicts on its periphery (Libya, Syria, Sahel) send migrant flows and security threats (terrorism) into Europe, affecting internal politics. Overall, Europe has moved from a post-Cold War peace to being on the frontlines of a renewed East-West divide. The key geographic variation within Europe is between NATO/EU countries (which have collective security but also could be drawn into war if a member is attacked) and countries outside those structures (like Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia) which are in precarious positions. In summary, **Europe’s risk profile** is centered on Russian aggression and the durability of Western unity; much hinges on the outcome in Ukraine and the future of Russia’s posture.

- **Asia-Pacific:** Asia is arguably the most complex and consequential geopolitical theater of the 21st century. It hosts multiple potential conflict hotspots: the **Taiwan Strait** is seen as one of the most dangerous flashpoints, with China vowing unification (by force if necessary) and the US committed to Taiwan’s defense – any conflict there could quickly escalate to a US-China war involving other allies like Japan and Australia. The South China Sea is another area of tension, where China’s expansive territorial claims and military base-building on disputed islands clash with claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, and others; freedom of navigation operations by Western navies to challenge China’s claims occasionally lead to tense encounters. On the Korean Peninsula, North Korea’s relentless missile and nuclear tests keep a risk of sudden conflagration (for instance, a misfired missile or provocation at the DMZ could spiral). South Asia has long-standing flashpoints: India and Pakistan (both nuclear-armed) have a volatile rivalry, exemplified by skirmishes in Kashmir and a major crisis in 2019 after a terrorist attack – any future crisis carries nuclear escalation risk. India-China relations are also strained after deadly clashes on their Himalayan border in 2020; while a full war is unlikely, both have reinforced troops there, and Asia’s two giants remain locked in strategic competition across the Indian Ocean and South Asia. Southeast Asia balances between major powers – nations like Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia seek to uphold their own interests amid US-China rivalry, using ASEAN as a platform for diplomacy, but are nervous about being caught in the middle if things worsen. The **trend in Asia** is a regional arms buildup: Japan is boosting its military, Taiwan is extending conscription, Australia is acquiring nuclear submarines (via AUKUS) – all responses to the perceived China threat. Meanwhile, China’s Belt and Road investments give it economic leverage, and it’s establishing security ties (e.g., a controversial security pact with the Solomon Islands in 2022). Asia also has thriving economies deeply interdependent with each other; this has historically moderated tensions (no one wants to scare off investors or disrupt trade), but nationalism is rising in many countries. In summary, Asia-Pacific faces **multi-directional tensions** – East Asia’s great power rivalry, Southeast Asia’s maritime disputes, South Asia’s historical animosities – making it a region with both high conflict potential and significant efforts at diplomacy (e.g., frequent summits, ASEAN forums, backchannels between US-China). Geography (maritime vs continental, archipelagos vs heartlands) also shapes conflict scenarios here, e.g., naval and air power are critical in the Pacific, whereas large armies matter on the Asian mainland.

- **Middle East and North Africa (MENA):** The Middle East remains one of the world’s most volatile regions, though its dynamics are shifting. Historically entrenched conflicts – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rivalries among Gulf powers, civil wars in Arab states – continue, but new patterns emerged in the early 2020s. In 2023, a devastating war erupted between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, killing thousands, and briefly risked drawing in Hezbollah in Lebanon or even Iran (which would have regional repercussions). Although a wider war was averted, the situation is extremely fragile, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has fueled anger across the Arab world, straining treaties like the Abraham Accords. Iran’s role is pivotal: its nuclear program is closer than ever to weapons capability, raising tensions with Israel (which might contemplate preemptive strikes) and Sunni Arab states. Yet, paradoxically, **diplomacy has seen successes**: Iran and Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic ties in 2023 in a deal brokered by China, easing their proxy battles in Yemen and elsewhere. This détente led to a ceasefire in Yemen that largely held, reducing one major war. Still, proxy conflicts persist – Syria remains carved into spheres (with Turkish, Iranian, Russian, and US influences), and Iraq and Lebanon are arenas for Iran vs. West competition through militias and politics. The Middle East is also where global powers intersect: Russia has a military foothold in Syria; the US maintains bases across the Gulf; China is now a major investor and diplomatic player. One recent feature is the Abraham Accords (Israel’s normalization with UAE, Bahrain, etc.), which realigned part of the region and created a loose Arab-Israeli partnership against Iran – though the Gaza war put stress on that alignment. North Africa, too, has instability (Libya is split between rival governments backed by external powers like Turkey, Russia, Egypt, UAE; Sudan fell into a new civil war in 2023 between rival generals, risking spillover along the Red Sea). The region’s huge oil and gas resources mean any conflict here affects global energy supplies, giving MENA conflicts outsized global significance. Geographically, MENA tensions often revolve around chokepoints and cross-border influences – the Strait of Hormuz (through which a significant share of the world’s oil passes) is a perennial hotspot with Iran periodically threatening shipping, the Bab al-Mandab near Yemen affects Red Sea trade, and the Eastern Mediterranean now has gas field disputes (Turkey vs Cyprus/Israel). In essence, the Middle East is a region where **old feuds meet new alliances**: sectarian divides (Sunni-Shia) overlay geopolitical contests (Saudi vs Iran, Israel vs Iran), and while some conflicts cooled (ISIS was largely defeated, Yemen’s war de-escalated), others ignited (Israel-Gaza) or could ignite (a confrontation over Iran’s nuclear program). The coming years in MENA will likely be a test of whether nascent diplomacy (like Saudi-Iran talks) can hold off another cycle of full-scale wars.

- **Africa:** Africa’s geopolitical tensions often stem from state fragility, but external powers are increasingly involved. **Sub-Saharan Africa** has few interstate wars but many internal conflicts and coups that have international dimensions. The Sahel region is a prime example: countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have suffered jihadist insurgencies and multiple coups, creating a belt of instability that foreign actors are exploiting – Russia (via Wagner mercenaries) has gained influence in Mali and Central African Republic as France’s presence wanes, indicative of a renewed great-power play for influence on the continent. In East Africa, Ethiopia’s brutal Tigray war (2020-2022) drew in Eritrea and had regional implications (with Sudan and Egypt watching closely due to Nile waters); although that war ended with a peace deal, Ethiopia’s stability is still tenuous and ethnic conflicts persist. Sudan’s new war (2023) between military factions threatens to destabilize its neighbors (Chad, South Sudan) and has drawn diplomatic interventions from the UN, African Union, and Gulf states. The Great Lakes region (DR Congo, etc.) remains volatile with dozens of armed groups and neighboring Rwanda and Uganda getting involved at times. **Africa’s conflicts are often fueled by competition over resources** (minerals, land) and grievances, but they are increasingly internationalized by peacekeeping missions or external patrons. Another dimension is China’s and the West’s economic rivalry in Africa: huge Chinese investments in infrastructure and mining have given it leverage, while the US and Europe are trying to offer alternatives (e.g., G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure). This economic competition is mostly peaceful, but in countries with strategic assets (like rare minerals in DRC needed for tech), there’s a risk of proxy competition or at least intense diplomatic tussles. African states also exercise agency – forming regional coalitions like ECOWAS, which in 2023 threatened military intervention to reverse the coup in Niger (though ultimately opting for sanctions), showing a regional security response to instability. However, those efforts have met mixed results (e.g., ECOWAS intervened in Gambia successfully in 2017, but has been unable to address the cascade of Sahelian coups effectively). North Africa ties into Middle East dynamics – Egypt faces tension with Ethiopia over the Nile dam, Libya’s chaos sees Middle Eastern and Russian meddling. **Geographically, Africa’s vast size means conflicts are localized, but fragile borders and ethnic ties can spread violence** (as seen with Boko Haram affecting Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad). Climate change hits Africa hard, contributing to farmer-herder clashes and food insecurity that can spark unrest. In summary, Africa’s geopolitical risk is characterized by **internal conflicts with external linkages** – the risk of interstate war is lower than elsewhere, but state collapses or coups are high, which can invite international intervention or become arenas for great power influence (a softer form of geopolitical rivalry playing out via mercenaries, aid competition, and diplomatic alignment). The trend of military coups also represents a challenge to the international normative order (democracy, rule of law), and how African and global institutions handle this will affect stability.

- **Americas:** The Americas (North and South) are relatively more stable geopolitically, with no active interstate wars, but they face their own tensions and risks. In **North America**, the main issue is the domestic polarization within the United States – as the world’s foremost military power, internal U.S. divisions can influence global geopolitics. A less interventionist or more isolationist U.S. (if domestic politics push that way) could leave power vacuums in other regions; conversely, a U.S. distracted by internal strife might embolden adversaries. U.S.-China rivalry extends into the Americas too – China has become a top trade partner for many Latin countries and invests in strategic infrastructure (like ports) in the Western Hemisphere, which the U.S. monitors warily (e.g., concerns about a Chinese-run port in Panama or tech influence in telecom networks). **Latin America** has few classic geopolitical conflicts currently, but notable are the Venezuela crisis and great power interests: Venezuela’s economic collapse and authoritarian turn led to a proxy diplomatic battle, with Russia, China, and Cuba supporting the Maduro regime and the U.S. and European countries backing the opposition (even initially recognizing an alternative president). While that standoff didn’t turn into external military intervention, it exemplified how global rivalries can manifest in the region. The Caribbean and Central America see competition mainly in economic aid and influence between Taiwan and China (a number of small states shifted recognition to Beijing in recent years under Chinese pressure, which has geopolitical signaling value). The major issues in Latin America are internal: high crime (e.g., Mexican cartels), political populism, and economic instability – these can indirectly become geopolitical if, say, a collapse in a large country triggers a refugee crisis (the Venezuelan exodus of millions has affected Colombia, Brazil, and beyond) or if outside actors exploit the instability (Iran and Hezbollah had a footprint in some Latin American illicit networks, causing U.S. concern). The Arctic region, partly North American (Canada, U.S.) and partly Eurasian (Russia), is emerging as an area of strategic competition due to melting ice opening shipping lanes and resource access; Canada and the U.S. vs Russia (and to some degree interested parties like China) will have to manage new Arctic tensions, although cooperation via the Arctic Council was one bright spot until Russia’s Ukraine war paused that forum. Geographically, the Western Hemisphere benefits from being far from Eurasia’s main conflict zones, and the Monroe Doctrine historically kept external powers limited. Now, though, Russia’s and China’s presence via political alliances (like with Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua) or economic ties is testing that paradigm. The U.S. has also formed a trilateral security pact with Mexico and Canada to focus on organized crime and other non-state threats. Overall, **the Americas’ geopolitical climate** is mild compared to others – most disputes are diplomatic or economic, and regional cooperation mechanisms (OAS, Mercosur, etc.) focus on trade and democracy. A critical watchpoint is how the U.S. manages its global role amid domestic changes, and how Latin America manages external courtship without becoming a theater for big power confrontation.

- **Global Commons (polar regions, oceans, space, cyber):** In addition to geographic regions, there are cross-cutting “regions” like the **maritime domain** (world’s sea lanes) and **cyberspace** that matter globally. Freedom of navigation in major sea lanes (South China Sea, Strait of Hormuz, Black Sea, etc.) is a constant concern – naval build-ups by China, India, and others mean more frequent naval encounters. The world’s oceans are also seeing a quiet naval arms race (more submarines, underwater drones, etc.) which could lead to accidents. The **polar regions** – the Arctic and Antarctic – are increasingly politicized: the Arctic, as noted, has Russia and NATO states vying gently (so far) for influence; the Antarctic, governed by a treaty, could see more contention when the treaty system is up for review in the 2040s over resources. **Space** is an emerging security theater: satellite constellations critical for communications and GPS are vulnerable, and multiple countries have demonstrated anti-satellite weapons. A conflict on Earth could quickly extend to attacks in space, multiplying impacts by knocking out services globally. **Cyberspace** has no borders: a cyber attack can ricochet globally (as with the 2017 NotPetya malware, initially targeting Ukraine, but causing billions in damage worldwide). Thus, geographic boundaries mean less in cyber conflict – NATO, for instance, has considered that a severe cyberattack could trigger collective defense. These “global commons” domains overlay the physical regions and add new layers of geopolitical risk that are not confined to one locale.

In summary, every region of the world faces some facet of geopolitical tension, but in different forms: **open warfare in parts of Europe and Middle East, high-stakes standoffs in East Asia, pervasive instability in parts of Africa, and strategic jockeying in the Americas and polar areas**. Regional flashpoints can ignite global crises because of alliances and the interconnected nature of trade and technology. Resilience planning must therefore be region-specific but globally informed – a crisis in one area (e.g., the South China Sea) can have far-reaching implications (affecting trade routes, prompting reactions in distant capitals). Appreciating these geographic nuances is crucial to prioritizing conflict prevention and crisis response efforts worldwide.

## Adaptation and Mitigation

In response to escalating geopolitical risks, a variety of adaptation and mitigation efforts are underway by international institutions, states, and civil society. However, their effectiveness varies, and many are falling short given the scale of the challenge:

- **Diplomatic Engagements and Peace Initiatives:** Traditional diplomacy remains the primary tool to prevent and resolve conflicts. There have been numerous peace talks and negotiations in recent years: for instance, talks brokered by Turkey and the UN led to the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022, allowing Ukrainian grain exports despite the war (a partial mitigation of conflict impact, though Russia withdrew from the deal in mid-2023). Envoys from neutral parties (like Turkey, Israel, China, or the Vatican) have at times shuttled between Russia and Ukraine to seek de-escalation or at least humanitarian corridors. While a comprehensive peace in Ukraine has not been achieved, these efforts helped manage specific risks (e.g., avoiding direct NATO-Russia clashes and keeping some communication open). In other conflict zones, UN Special Envoys and regional mediators are active: ceasefires have been negotiated in Yemen (2022) and Sudan (multiple short truces in 2023) with outside facilitation. The Abraham Accords (2020) were a diplomatic breakthrough reducing Israel-Arab state tensions, and ongoing **talks on Iran’s nuclear issue** (JCPOA revival attempts or interim deals) aim to avert a crisis. Across Africa, the African Union and sub-regional bodies (like ECOWAS, IGAD) have mediation panels – the AU brokered the Ethiopia-Tigray peace agreement in 2022, successfully halting that war. These diplomatic efforts are crucial “safety valves,” and even when they don’t fully resolve conflicts, they can mitigate worst outcomes (like prisoner exchanges or deconfliction mechanisms). _However_, many peace processes are fragile or stalled – e.g., Syrian peace talks have yielded little, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is moribund. The **effectiveness of diplomacy is often curtailed by lack of high-level consensus** among major powers (if they are on opposing sides of a conflict).

- **International Institutions and Norm-Setting:** Institutions like the United Nations, though strained, still play a role in managing tensions. The UN Security Council authorizes peacekeeping missions that serve as buffers in conflict zones (currently, ~12 UN peace operations are deployed worldwide, though notably not in Ukraine due to great-power veto dynamics). The UN also remains a forum where big powers sometimes coordinate – for instance, the Security Council unanimously renewed humanitarian aid access in Syria despite differences, indicating some minimal cooperation. Outside the UN, new forums have emerged: the **G20**, while economic in focus, was used to discuss geopolitical issues (such as issuing statements on not using nuclear weapons in Ukraine at the 2022 Bali summit – an indirect form of norm reinforcement). The **ASEAN Regional Forum** provides a platform for Asian powers to discuss security issues and prevent miscalculations in the Indo-Pacific. Furthermore, there have been attempts to establish norms in **cyberspace**: the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and an Open-Ended Working Group have gotten states to affirm that international law applies in cyberspace and agreed on norms like not attacking critical infrastructure in peacetime ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=This%20becomes%20an%20even%20more,from%20malware%20to%20biological%20weapons)). While these are voluntary, they at least set expectations and have been endorsed by major cyber powers. Similarly, discussions on limiting autonomous weapons are taking place under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) – though progress is slow, it’s a sign of proactive mitigation of future risk. In trade, institutions like the WTO are trying to update rules to handle national security exceptions so that every trade dispute doesn’t escalate; the WTO has also facilitated some dispute settlements informally even when its Appellate Body is defunct. The **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)** has been actively mitigating nuclear risks – e.g., negotiating safety measures around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine to prevent a radiation disaster ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=risks,translated%20into%20Ukrainian%20and%20Russian)). In global commons, the new UN High Seas Treaty (2023) for ocean biodiversity, while not directly geopolitical, shows nations can still agree on some rules that may reduce future resource conflicts at sea. The **shortfall** is that institutions often lack enforcement power or consensus when it comes to the most sensitive issues (war and peace involving major states), but they are adapting by focusing on narrower achievable goals (like cyber norms or nuclear safety protocols) as interim risk-reduction measures.

- **Alliances and Security Assurances:** Military alliances have taken steps to strengthen deterrence, which is a double-edged sword for risk (it can deter aggression but also intensify the standoff). NATO, for example, has increased the readiness of its rapid response forces, forward-deployed battlegroups to Eastern members, and conducted more frequent drills – measures intended to reassure allies and signal resolve to adversaries. In the Indo-Pacific, new security partnerships (the Quad grouping of the US, Japan, India, Australia; AUKUS for nuclear-submarine sharing; and expanded US defense agreements with Philippines and others) aim to **deter potential aggressors like North Korea or discourage a forcible Taiwan scenario** by raising the potential costs. These efforts are mitigating in that they seek to _prevent_ conflict through strength and unity. However, they also lock in adversarial postures and can feed the security dilemma if not coupled with diplomacy. To balance that, there are also **military-to-military communication channels** being re-established: after a hiatus, U.S. and Chinese defense officials resumed talks in late 2023 to reduce chances of accidents between their forces. NATO and Russia maintain some deconfliction channels (for instance, in Syria). Such communication mechanisms are a subtle yet vital mitigation tool – they prevented incidents during the Cold War and are being modernized (like hotlines for cyber incidents or space collisions).

- **Conflict Prevention and Early Warning:** International actors have not given up on prevention. The UN has a Conflict Prevention architecture (e.g., the Secretary-General’s special advisers who can do shuttle diplomacy quietly). Regional organizations, like the OSCE in Europe, monitor tensions (the OSCE had observers in Ukraine before the war and continues to be involved in conflict monitoring in places like the Caucasus). The **International Crisis Group** and other NGOs provide regular early-warning reports (such as “10 Conflicts to Watch” lists ([10 Conflicts to Watch in 2024 | Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2024#:~:text=10%20Conflicts%20to%20Watch%20in,to%20end%20fighting%20are%20failing))) to focus attention on brewing crises. Some governments have units dedicated to scanning for instability abroad that might require mediation or humanitarian intervention. Financial institutions (World Bank, IMF) are also considering fragility in their aid – directing funds to fragile states in hopes of stabilizing them before conflict erupts. For example, the G20 has discussed creating ‘stability funds’ for countries at risk of collapse. These efforts represent a mitigation strategy by addressing root causes: poverty, poor governance, etc., under initiatives like the UN’s Sustaining Peace resolutions. The challenge is that in a world of high tensions, the political willingness and funding to prioritize prevention often falter; nonetheless, frameworks like the **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)** norm and various diplomatic working groups (for example, the P5 process among nuclear powers to reaffirm no one can win a nuclear war) are aimed at preempting worst-case outcomes.

- **Mitigating Economic Warfare:** On the geoeconomic front, efforts to mitigate the impact of fragmentation include dialogue and partial agreements. The U.S. and China, amid their rivalry, have engaged in periodic trade talks and minor deals (like China pledging to buy more U.S. goods in the Phase One trade deal of 2020, though tensions later resumed). The EU has been trying to act as a regulatory superpower to set standards that both U.S. and China might adhere to, to avoid bifurcation (for example, on tech privacy or AI governance, which could create common ground). In supply chains, companies and governments are pursuing “de-risking” (diversification) rather than full decoupling, which is a moderated approach: this could mitigate extreme economic fallout by maintaining some interdependence. Moreover, there are diplomatic efforts to manage specific economic flashpoints: OPEC+ (which includes Russia) coordinates oil production to prevent price wars that could have geopolitical implications; the G7’s price cap on Russian oil is an innovative sanction designed to keep oil flowing but reduce war revenues – its efficacy is debated, but it did show creative thinking to mitigate collateral damage of sanctions. On the flipside, forums like the **G20** and IMF push messaging that beggar-thy-neighbor policies will hurt all, implicitly encouraging restraint in using trade as a weapon. Currency swap lines and multilateral development bank lending have been used to cushion countries facing commodity shocks from wars (e.g., IMF food shock financing in 2022), which helps prevent those economic shocks from turning into political unrest.

- **Civil Society and Backchannel Efforts:** Outside official channels, there are countless civil society initiatives aimed at reducing tensions. “Track II” dialogues (informal talks between retired officials and experts from rival countries) have been ongoing between Americans and Chinese, Russians and Americans, Indians and Pakistanis, etc., to keep communication alive and generate ideas for conflict resolution that official channels might later adopt. Cultural and academic exchanges, while fewer than before, still provide some connective tissue (for example, joint climate research by U.S. and Chinese scientists continues despite political strains). Citizen diplomacy and city-level cooperation (like sister city programs or mayoral summits) create pockets of collaboration that can survive during national disputes. The media and information sphere also see pushes for moderation – some independent media and fact-checkers work to counter war propaganda and reduce the spread of incendiary fake news that could inflame conflicts. These efforts, albeit small in scale, contribute to **resilience** by fostering cross-border understanding and keeping some avenues of empathy open.

Despite all the above, the **effectiveness of current mitigation is limited**. As noted by the UN Secretary-General, the gap between the need for collective action and actual cooperation is wide ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=and%20normative%20contestation%20over%20principles,Russia%E2%80%99s%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine%2C%20on)). Many peace processes remain incomplete – for instance, in Ukraine the fighting continues unabated; in Syria, peace talks have not ended the war. Preventive diplomacy often struggles to gain traction until a conflict has already erupted (the proverbial “fire brigade” problem versus fire prevention). Arms control is in retreat, not advancing – efforts to bring new technologies into regulatory frameworks lag behind their weaponization. And while deterrence measures may have prevented some aggression, they also contribute to a costly arms buildup and paranoia. The polycrisis nature means even well-intended actions in one domain (like sanctioning an aggressor) can have adverse side-effects (like hurting food security).

Nonetheless, there are **glimmers of adaptive strategies**: countries are seeking to build **resilience** to geopolitical shocks – e.g., Europe rapidly reduced dependency on Russian gas in one year, a form of adaptation that blunts the impact of Russia’s leverage. Many nations are adopting a policy of “non-alignment 2.0” (hedging between great powers) to avoid entanglement – this can mitigate the formation of rigid hostile blocs. Organizations and cities are building sister networks to share best practices on crisis management (like how to handle cyber incidents or disinformation surges during elections). The concept of **“Minilateralism”** is rising – small groups of relevant states cooperating on a specific issue (like the coalition that fought ISIS, or the Black Sea grain deal quartet) – which can be more agile than universal institutions.

In conclusion, while existing adaptation and mitigation efforts **have had some successes** (preventing certain escalations, resolving a few conflicts, managing some economic spillovers), they are **not keeping pace** with the breadth and intensity of geopolitical tensions. The global community is essentially **firefighting** multiple blazes with limited hoses. Strengthening these efforts – revitalizing diplomacy, reforming institutions, investing in peacebuilding – is widely recognized as necessary. But until that happens on a larger scale, the world is relying on patchwork solutions and the hope that deterrence and dialogue, however tenuous, will hold the line against a broader breakdown.

## Critical Uncertainties

Looking ahead, there are pivotal uncertainties that make the trajectory of geopolitical risk difficult to predict. These “known unknowns” could dramatically alter risk levels depending on how they resolve:

- **Outcome of Ongoing Conflicts:** A foremost uncertainty is how and when major current wars end. Will Russia’s war in Ukraine grind into a frozen stalemate, escalate (potentially involving NATO directly or nuclear use), or end in a negotiated settlement? Each scenario has vastly different implications: a settlement could allow sanctions to ease and deterrence to be re-established, whereas escalation could bring Europe into a broader war. Similarly, the Israel–Palestine conflict’s evolution is uncertain – if a sustainable truce or political agreement emerges after 2023’s war, regional tempers may cool; if fighting reignites or expands to involve Hezbollah/Iran, the Middle East could spiral into a multi-front war. The durability of ceasefires in places like Yemen or Ethiopia also remains unclear – relapse into war versus progress to peace will shape regional stability. Essentially, the **question of whether current flashpoints settle or spread** is a huge uncertainty hanging over the near future.

- **Leadership Changes and Domestic Politics:** The geopolitical outlook could shift with upcoming leadership turnovers in key countries. The 2024 U.S. presidential election is one major wildcard: a change in U.S. leadership could lead to policy shifts such as reduced support for Ukraine, different tone towards allies, or a tougher vs softer line on China. That in turn would alter calculations in Moscow, Beijing, and European capitals. In Russia, President Putin’s tenure through 2030 is uncertain – if he were to leave power unexpectedly (due to health, coup, etc.), Russia’s foreign policy could either become even more hardline under a nationalist successor or potentially more conciliatory if a pragmatist takes charge; the transition itself could be destabilizing given Russia’s nuclear arsenal. China’s internal stability and Xi Jinping’s grip on power is another factor: while Xi has consolidated control, unforeseen crises (economic trouble, public unrest) in China could push its leadership to externalize via nationalism (e.g., stoking a Taiwan crisis) or conversely, force a focus inward and a more cautious foreign stance. Many other nations have elections or transitions (e.g., Taiwan’s 2024 election – outcome will affect cross-strait relations significantly; hardline vs moderate leadership in Iran; elections in volatile democracies like Pakistan, Nigeria, etc.). **Political shifts can rapidly change foreign policy** – witness how the rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2018 suddenly ended a 20-year standoff, or how a coup can realign a country overnight (like Mali pivoting from France to Russia). Therefore, who governs the major and regional powers in the coming years – and their ideology/priorities – is a huge uncertainty.

- **China-Taiwan and U.S.-China Relations:** While this is an ongoing tension, its future trajectory is highly uncertain and critically important. Does China decide to attempt reunification with Taiwan by force in the next 5-10 years, or does it indefinitely postpone that in favor of peaceful methods? Some experts project a window of maximum danger around late 2020s when China’s military might feel it has sufficient capability. But it’s uncertain because it depends on Chinese perceptions of U.S. resolve, Taiwan’s own actions (do they move toward de jure independence or maintain the status quo?), and Xi’s risk appetite. A related uncertainty is whether U.S.-China competition stabilizes through partial agreements (on trade, cyber, arms) or escalates into a full Cold War or even direct conflict. Currently, both cooperation (on say climate or macroeconomic stability) and confrontation (South China Sea, tech sanctions) are in mix. If unexpected crises occur – e.g., an accident in the South China Sea, or a severe economic downturn in China prompting nationalist distraction – the relationship could nose-dive. Conversely, improved diplomacy (resuming mil-to-mil communications, negotiating limits on certain weapon deployments or tech) could establish a new equilibrium. The range of outcomes is broad, from _detente_ (unlikely but possible if both sides see conflict as too costly and agree on coexistence frameworks) to _open conflict_ (in a dire scenario). This uncertainty looms over all long-term planning.

- **Nuclear Proliferation and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Events:** A major uncertainty is whether the normative taboo on nuclear use holds indefinitely. The Ukraine war raised this question starkly with nuclear threats. The risk of nuclear weapon use – intentional or accidental – is hard to quantify but real; a single use would shatter norms and potentially escalate into larger nuclear exchange. We don’t know how a nuclear crisis would play out in a multipolar nuclear world (with 9 nuclear states). Additionally, will more countries acquire nuclear weapons? Candidates often mentioned include Iran (if talks fail and they feel threatened) and potentially others like Saudi Arabia (if Iran goes nuclear) or South Korea/Japan (if North Korean threats grow and faith in U.S. umbrella wanes). Nuclear proliferation could drastically heighten geopolitical risks, creating new rivalries or destabilizing deterrence in regions that lack the kind of communication that existed in the US-Soviet Cold War. Another WMD aspect: advances in biotechnology could potentially enable new forms of bio-weapons or incidents – the COVID-19 pandemic, while natural (as far as evidence shows), illustrated the global havoc a pathogen can cause amid mutual suspicion. An intentional or accidentally released pathogen in a hostile context could be viewed as a bioweapon, with unpredictable consequences. So, **uncertainty in WMD domain** – nuclear, chemical, bio – remains a shadow: the hope is norms hold and treaties eventually strengthen, but breakdowns here would be catastrophic, making it a key uncertainty that strategists monitor (e.g., will the NPT regime hold together under stress?).

- **Global Economic Trajectory:** The state of the global economy could either aggravate or alleviate geopolitical tensions. A robust global recovery with low inflation might reduce domestic pressures that lead to scapegoating and protectionism, potentially giving leaders more bandwidth to compromise internationally. Conversely, a severe recession or debt crisis (which is possible given high global debt and tightening financial conditions) could heighten nationalist economics and competition for resources. If, for example, emerging markets face a wave of debt defaults, China and the West might clash over how to handle bailouts, or countries might turn inward, slashing foreign aid and cooperation budgets. Trade dynamics are uncertain – will supply chain reconfiguration lead to resilience or balkanization? Also, the race for technological supremacy in sectors like AI and semiconductors has economic and security facets: if one side jumps ahead in a key tech (say, quantum computing), does that upset the balance or spur a counter-coalition? _Uncertainty:_ whether globalization further unwinds or finds a new equilibrium of partial connectivity. The IMF’s scenarios range from limited fragmentation (just tech-focused decoupling) to extreme (splitting the world economy in two), with the latter far more dangerous ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=While%20estimates%20of%20the%20cost,Saharan%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20annual%20output)).

- **Climate and Environmental Shocks:** The pace and severity of climate change is an uncertainty with direct geopolitical consequences. If climate impacts accelerate (e.g., a run of extreme disasters hitting multiple big economies, or a “climate tipping point” like collapse of monsoon or Arctic ice opening up sooner), countries might be forced into more cooperative behavior out of sheer necessity – or alternatively, climate stress might ignite conflict over resources before cooperation kicks in. For instance, the mid-2020s to 2030s will reveal if certain regions become unlivably hot or dry; that could lead to large migrations (e.g., millions moving out of parts of South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa), which could trigger border crises and nationalist backlashes in receiving countries. Another uncertainty is if we will see **geoengineering** attempts (like stratospheric aerosol injection) and how that might create geopolitical rifts (one country doing it unilaterally could affect others’ climates, a new source of conflict). So while climate change is a certainty in direction, its exact manifestations and the human responses are uncertain and could either distract from geopolitical feuds via shared crisis or fuel them via scarcity and disasters.

- **Technological Game-Changers:** We don’t know which specific new technologies might dramatically shift the balance of power or the nature of conflict by 2030. Some candidates: a breakthrough in **artificial general intelligence** (AGI) or military AI could confer great advantage to whoever leads it (or could run out of control, a sci-fi but not impossible risk, adding a global security threat). If one country achieves a reliable **quantum computer** that breaks all encryption, it could instantly cripple others’ secure communications – a potential geopolitical earthquake. On the other hand, tech could also help mitigate conflict – better surveillance (satellites, AI analysis) might improve verification of treaties or provide early warning to prevent surprise attacks (some argue the omnipresence of satellite imagery now makes large covert military buildups hard to hide, theoretically reducing Pearl Harbor-like scenarios). Another tech uncertainty is energy tech: if green energy and battery breakthroughs drastically reduce dependency on fossil fuels, petrostates’ influence might wane (potentially causing internal instability in some, but reducing strategic choke points like the Gulf). Conversely, if carbon capture or something fails and energy transition falters, climate woes worsen and countries might double-down on competing for remaining fossil fuels. Thus, the direction of tech – both military and dual-use – is a wild card for geopolitics.

- **Black Swan Events:** Beyond these specific areas, there is always the possibility of unforeseen events – a massive terrorist attack (on the scale of 9/11 or bigger, perhaps with nuclear or biological materials), a sudden collapse of a major state (imagine if a large country fragmentizes or an EU member exits NATO unexpectedly, etc.), or new pandemics – which could reorder priorities and alliances overnight. The surprise rapprochement (like the 1972 Nixon visit to China) or unexpected peace treaty is also a possibility that can’t be ruled out. These low-probability but high-impact events form the fog of the future. For instance, a major terrorist incident could either unite countries against a common threat (as 9/11 initially did) or create waves of xenophobia and military overreach (Iraq war) that then alter global stability.

In sum, **critical uncertainties revolve around conflict resolutions, leadership decisions, technological leaps, and external shocks**. Decision-makers must plan for a range of scenarios: best case (gradual stabilization of rivalries, reforms of multilateral system, avoidance of new wars) and worst case (simultaneous conflicts, uncontrolled arms races, fragmentation of global order). Because these uncertainties are dynamic and interdependent (e.g., a leadership change might steer a conflict to resolution, or an economic crash might precipitate a coup), flexibility and constant monitoring are key. Scenario planning typically envisions multiple futures – for instance, a scenario where U.S.-China find a modus vivendi vs one where they enter cold war and proxy fights – each tied to certain indicators (like rhetoric tones, military incidents, alliance shifts) that we can watch. Navigating these uncertainties is what makes strategic foresight challenging yet vital in the current era.

## Expert Consensus

Experts and strategic analysts broadly agree that geopolitical tensions have entered a perilous phase, though there is debate on how likely worst-case outcomes are and on the best ways to address the risk. Here’s an overview of areas of consensus and disagreement:

**Areas of Agreement:** There is a strong consensus that the risk of interstate conflict and great-power confrontation is at its highest since at least the end of the Cold War, and many argue since the Cuban Missile Crisis or even World War II. For example, a recent survey for the World Economic Forum found that **84% of global experts are concerned about the short-term outlook (next 2 years) and 92% are pessimistic about the next decade** ([The Global Risks Report 2024 - 19th Edition | Zurich Insurance](https://www.zurich.com/knowledge/topics/global-risks/the-global-risks-report-2024#:~:text=As%20we%20enter%202024%2C%202023,are%20pessimistic)), citing geopolitical fragmentation as a major driver of that pessimism. The **U.N. Secretary-General** and other prominent figures routinely warn that the world is “one miscalculation away” from catastrophe ([The U.N. chief says we are 'one miscalculation away from nuclear ...](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/02/1115160155/guterres-one-miscalculation-away-nuclear-annihilation#:~:text=The%20U,)). The **Bulletin of Atomic Scientists**, comprising leading security experts, moved the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to midnight in 2023 – the most dire setting ever – explicitly due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, nuclear threats, and the breakdown in global cooperation ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20living%20in%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=The%20Doomsday%20Clock%20statement%20explains,Efforts%20by)). This reflects an expert consensus that current trends are extremely worrying. Security think tanks (e.g., **IISS, SIPRI, CSIS**) consistently report on the uptick in conflicts and military expenditures ([Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 | SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2024/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2023#:~:text=World%20military%20expenditure%20increased%20for,highest%20since%201990%2C%20at%20%24306)) ([Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 | SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2024/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2023#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20global%20military,Oceania%20and%20the%20Middle%20East)), reinforcing the view that tensions are not a transient phenomenon but a structural shift. There’s also agreement that **geopolitical tensions intersect with other risks** to form a polycrisis; for instance, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2024 described the world as “plagued by a duo of dangerous crises: climate and conflict” ([These are the biggest global risks we face in 2024 and beyond | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/#:~:text=A%20pessimistic%20global%20outlook)), underlining that experts see these issues converging.

Most experts concur on specific risk areas: virtually all defense analysts agree that Taiwan is a flashpoint of major concern, and that NATO-Russia relations are at their lowest point in decades. **Cybersecurity experts** almost unanimously believe that geopolitics and cyber risk are entwined – in a WEF 2023 survey, 91% of cyber leaders feared that geopolitical instability will lead to a catastrophic cyber event ([2023 was a big year for cybercrime – here’s how we can make our systems safer | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/cybersecurity-cybercrime-system-safety/#:~:text=This%20article%20is%20part%20of%3A,World%20Economic%20Forum%20Annual%20Meeting)) ([2023 was a big year for cybercrime – here’s how we can make our systems safer | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/cybersecurity-cybercrime-system-safety/#:~:text=Cybercrime%20is%20a%20real%20and,in%20the%20next%20two%20years)). Economists at institutions like the IMF and World Bank echo concerns that geopolitical fragmentation is a serious threat to global economic stability and development – the IMF Managing Director warned that fragmentation could cost trillions in lost output ([The High Cost of Global Economic Fragmentation ](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/28/the-high-cost-of-global-economic-fragmentation#:~:text=While%20estimates%20of%20the%20cost,Saharan%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20annual%20output)). So across domains (security, economics, technology), the expert community recognizes geopolitical tension as a top-tier risk factor for the coming years.

**Areas of Disagreement:** Where experts diverge is often on _how_ these tensions will play out and what the probabilities are for extreme scenarios. For instance, there is debate on the likelihood of a direct U.S.-China military clash: some analysts (often in defense circles) argue it is a tangible risk within this decade (pointing to Chinese military developments and explicit warnings from U.S. admirals about conflict possibly by 2025-2027), whereas others (including many China specialists) contend that China’s strategy is more about gradual supremacy and that it will avoid a war which could derail its rise, meaning deterrence can hold. Similarly, on Russia, some experts believe that the Ukraine war could widen if Putin feels cornered, while others think Russia will remain bogged down and deterred from any NATO engagement, thus containing the conflict.

There’s also debate on whether we are in a _New Cold War_. Many Western experts describe the current U.S.-China and U.S.-Russia relations as a new Cold War-like situation of systemic rivalry. Others argue the Cold War analogy is imperfect – the world is more multipolar and economically interdependent, so we might not see two completely separate blocs, and we have to manage a complex set of relationships (for example, India is aligned with the West on some issues but with Russia on others, etc.). This leads to differing prescriptions: one camp emphasizes strengthening alliances and deterrence to stand up to adversaries (a more confrontational stance, assuming competition is here to stay), while another camp urges renewed diplomacy and compromise to avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy of conflict (pointing out, for example, that treating China solely as an enemy could cement them as one).

On the **risk of nuclear escalation**, some experts (often former officials like ex-U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry or scholars of deterrence) are extremely alarmist, saying nuclear use is closer now than at any time since 1962, citing reckless rhetoric and erosion of arms control. Other experts, often in the realist school of international relations, argue that nuclear deterrence is still robust and that despite rhetoric, rational actors will avoid crossing that line – essentially, they see nuclear war as _unlikely_ even if tensions are high. This disagreement affects policy stances on things like whether to push for disarmament initiatives or focus purely on deterrence.

Another debate is the _resilience of globalization:_ economists and political scientists differ on whether the current geoeconomic rifts will completely sever the global economy or just recalibrate it. Optimists note that trade flows (excluding Russia) have proven quite resilient so far and that outright decoupling is costly for all, so they expect some degree of continued integration. Pessimists point to export controls, sanctions, and security-driven industrial policy as signs that globalization as we knew it is over, potentially leading to long-term camps.

**Expert Insight and Notable Perspectives:** Many leading voices have weighed in on the seriousness of the situation. For instance, the **World Economic Forum’s 2024 report** explicitly states _“geopolitical tensions have become the single most important risk confronting the global economy”_ ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=1)). This encapsulates a consensus among economic experts that war and rivalry overshadow even inflation or other economic risks now. Former UN Secretary-General **Ban Ki-moon**, commenting on the Doomsday Clock, said leaders are not acting with sufficient urgency to address interconnected crises of war, climate, and pandemics ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=Rights%2C%20said%3A)) ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=Ban%20Ki,of%20the%20United%20Nations%2C%20said)), reflecting frustration in the expert community at political inertia. On the other hand, some geopolitical experts like **Henry Kissinger** (in his late-2022/2023 interviews and writings) have suggested that diplomacy with adversaries is still possible and necessary – for example, he controversially argued Ukraine might eventually have to accept negotiations, and also that the US should find a modus vivendi with China rather than pure containment. His views sparked debate, showing disagreement on _approach_ even if all agree the stakes are high.

One consensus point is the need for **foresight and preparation**: experts in strategic foresight and resilience widely advocate scenario planning for worst-case geopolitical disruptions given the uncertainty. Chief resilience officers and planners are advised to treat geopolitical upheaval as a when-not-if risk in their strategies. The language of “**polycrisis**” itself – popularized by thinkers like Nouriel Roubini and the WEF – indicates an expert understanding that geopolitical tensions will likely intersect with other crises, and planning must be holistic.

In summary, experts agree that **geopolitical risk is severe and rising**, making it a dominant concern for the 2020s. They also agree broadly on the drivers (power shifts, nationalism, etc.) and the fact that the old post-Cold War order is gone. They disagree on the likelihood of certain extreme outcomes (like great power war or nuclear use – ranging from moderate risk to low but non-zero risk) and on the correct mix of confrontation vs engagement to mitigate the dangers. There’s also debate on how _long-lasting_ this period will be – is it a temporary spike that could be reduced with some diplomatic successes, or are we in for a generational era of rivalry until a new balance is settled? This divergence in views leads to different recommended strategies, but virtually all experts underscore the importance of urgent action to shore up peace and stability mechanisms, because the current trajectory, if unaltered, is widely seen as unsustainable and hazardous.

## System Interactions

Geopolitical tensions do not exist in isolation; they interact with and influence other global risks, forming a complex risk web. Understanding these interactions is key to a systems-level analysis:

- **Climate Change and Environmental Stress:** Climate change and geopolitical tensions have a bidirectional, compounding relationship. On one hand, climate stress (extreme weather, droughts, resource scarcity) can act as a catalyst for conflict – often referred to as a “threat multiplier.” For example, prolonged drought contributed to social unrest in Syria prior to the civil war, and changing climate patterns in the Sahel have intensified competition between herders and farmers, fueling conflicts that jihadist groups exploit. As water sources like rivers and glaciers diminish, tensions rise between countries that share them (e.g., India and Pakistan over the Indus waters, or Egypt and Ethiopia over the Nile). We may see new forms of **climate wars** or climate-driven migration crises that heighten geopolitical frictions (massive displacement from, say, submerged coastal areas could destabilize regions). Conversely, active wars and rivalries hinder the global response to climate change. Cooperation on cutting emissions or on climate adaptation financing suffers when major powers are at odds – evident in how geopolitical distrust has slowed climate negotiations (global emissions are still not on track to the targets, partly because countries prioritize immediate strategic interests over long-term climate commitments). There’s also direct environmental damage from conflicts: warfare (like the oil well fires in Iraq, or potential damage to Ukraine’s nuclear plants) wreaks ecological havoc and adds to carbon emissions. Additionally, if great powers continue to invest heavily in fossil fuels for strategic reasons (e.g., Europe reopening coal plants due to loss of Russian gas), that delays the clean energy transition. A positive feedback loop emerges: more climate impact causes more instability and conflict, which then hampers climate action, leading to worse climate conditions. The World Economic Forum highlighted that we face a dual crisis of **“climate and conflict”** that together imperil humanity ([These are the biggest global risks we face in 2024 and beyond | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/#:~:text=A%20pessimistic%20global%20outlook)). This synergy means resilience strategies must link peacebuilding with climate adaptation – e.g., cooperative water management treaties can reduce conflict risk and improve climate resilience simultaneously.

- **Global Economic Stability and Inequality:** Geopolitical tensions strongly interact with economic risks. Conflict and sanctions lead to supply shocks and price volatility (as seen with food and fuel), which can trigger inflation and even social unrest (the 2022 cost-of-living protests in many countries had ties to post-pandemic and war-related inflation). Economic downturns or depressions can, in turn, foment nationalism, protectionism, and scapegoating of other nations or groups (historically, the Great Depression helped fuel extremist regimes). Right now, high geopolitical risk has dampened investor confidence in emerging markets near conflict zones or perceived to be in unstable regions, affecting development. Moreover, **geoeconomic fragmentation** – splitting of trade networks – can reduce global growth potential, which then strains national budgets and can lead to cutbacks in foreign aid or international cooperation as countries look inward. Conversely, a severe financial crisis might force rival powers to cooperate out of necessity (much like the U.S. and China coordinated stimulus during the 2008 crisis), temporarily easing tensions. There’s an interplay with inequality: sustained geopolitical crises (like wars) often exacerbate inequality (both within and between countries), as the poor suffer most from disruptions. High inequality can breed populist politics, which often have nationalist or anti-globalization flavors, feeding back into geopolitical posture (e.g., trade wars partly driven by domestic discontent over globalization’s unequal gains). We saw an example of this: disillusionment with global trade led to movements that challenged the status quo (Brexit, U.S. trade war), injecting volatility into the international system. So, **economic malaise and geopolitical conflict can form a vicious cycle**, but strategic policy (like cooperative economic relief efforts) could conversely act as a virtuous cycle catalyst, alleviating both economic and political tensions.

- **Pandemics and Global Health Security:** The COVID-19 pandemic showed how a health crisis can intersect with geopolitics. Instead of a globally coordinated response, we saw initial nationalist responses (export restrictions on PPE, vaccine hoarding by rich countries) and a blame game (U.S.-China relations deteriorated further with mutual accusations over the virus origin and handling). Thus, in a tense geopolitical climate, a pandemic can worsen divides – as happened, China and Russia later engaged in “vaccine diplomacy” to gain influence, and misinformation about vaccines often had geopolitical angles. If a new pandemic emerges, will countries cooperate better or will fragmentation deepen? That’s uncertain, but current trends of low trust suggest a risk that next time might also see fractured responses. Meanwhile, ongoing geopolitical instability harms health security – conflict zones become reservoirs for disease (polio resurgences in war-torn areas, or inability to quash Ebola during Congo’s insecurity). Large refugee movements due to war can spread diseases across borders. Additionally, bioterrorism or lab accidents are emergent risks that blend health and security – a state or non-state actor could weaponize pathogens, which is a security threat as much as a health one. And if such an event occurred, attributions and suspicions could themselves spark conflict (e.g., accusations of “biological warfare” flew around during COVID’s outbreak). Therefore, **health crises can be magnified by geopolitical rivalry**, and vice versa, prolonged tensions degrade the collective capacity to handle health emergencies.

- **Societal Instability and Misinformation:** Geopolitical tensions can exacerbate social cleavages within countries. External actors often use information warfare to deepen polarization or influence domestic politics in rival states – for instance, Russian disinformation campaigns in Western countries aim to amplify extremist voices and erode trust in institutions ([Global Risks Report 2024 | World Economic Forum | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/digest/#:~:text=Emerging%20as%20the%20most%20severe,to%20civil%20confrontation%20and%20terrorism)). This can weaken those societies from within, making them less resilient and more inward-focused, which then influences their foreign policy (a divided nation may project either erratic aggression or retreat). Domestically fragmented countries can also be seen as easier targets or less reliable allies, shifting the geopolitical chessboard. On the flip side, domestic extremism or authoritarian turns (societal instabilities) in one country can alarm others and heighten international tensions. For example, a coup or democratic breakdown might realign a country geopolitically (like Mali’s coup pushing it towards Russia, causing a rift with Western nations). Societal changes like demographic shifts (youth bulges in Africa, aging populations in Europe/Asia) interact with geopolitical economics (migration flows, labor markets) and can cause political friction between countries (migration crises testing relations, diaspora politics influencing bilateral ties). **Migration**, often a result of conflict or governance failure, has become a geopolitical issue itself – e.g., Belarus in 2021 allegedly engineered a migrant influx into EU neighbors, seen as a hybrid tactic. So internal and external security blur: global tensions feed internal tensions (through propaganda, fear of “the other”, militarization of society), and internal tensions feed global ones (through unstable state behavior, human rights issues becoming international points of contention).

- **Technological and Cyber Risks:** As discussed, technology is both a battleground and a potential tool for solutions. The interaction is such that rapid tech progress, without cooperative governance, intensifies geopolitical rivalry (whoever leads in AI, quantum, space, etc., gains power). Conversely, if rivals agree on some tech norms (like not proliferating certain AI weapons or ensuring cybersecurity cooperation for critical infrastructure), that could mitigate one dimension of their rivalry. Cyber risks particularly interplay with critical infrastructure – a cyberattack (attributable to a nation-state) could cripple power grids or financial systems, causing economic chaos that then might prompt a military response. It’s a cross-domain interaction: cyber war could trigger kinetic war. Meanwhile, strong geopolitical alliances can lead to tech alliances (like U.S. assembling a chip coalition to deny tech to China), fragmenting the global tech ecosystem (different standards, internets). This affects everything from internet freedom to the security of supply for technology components. There’s also the risk that technology outpaces norms – for instance, if _autonomous drone swarms_ become cheap and available, non-state actors might use them, complicating traditional state-centric security and potentially dragging states into new conflicts (e.g., if a terrorist group with autonomous drones causes mass casualties, states might respond by attacking the state that harbored them, etc.). In summary, **technological innovation can either ameliorate or aggravate geopolitical risk**, depending on governance. Currently, it’s trending to aggravate (cyber arms race, surveillance tech used in repression and exported, etc.), but initiatives like joint AI principles or cyber “rules of the road” are attempts to bend that curve.

- **Cross-Risk Multiplier – Polycrisis Synergy:** Geopolitical tension often acts as a multiplier for other risks, and other risks multiply geopolitical ones, creating a reinforcing feedback loop. As one striking illustration, consider how a confluence might play out: say a severe climate disaster (mega-drought) hits multiple grain-producing countries while an economic recession is underway; this drives up food prices and causes shortages, leading to riots in some import-dependent nations; those riots topple governments or spark harsh crackdowns; some states fracture or become more authoritarian; external powers intervene with aid or military force in some cases to protect interests or allies; that intervention sparks conflict with other powers or resentment, fueling proxy fights – all of a sudden, climate, economic, and political crises coalesce into new geopolitical conflicts. This hypothetical chain is the nightmare polycrisis scenario. The world came close to a mild version in 2022 when climate shocks (droughts in crop regions), pandemic aftershocks, and war in Ukraine all combined to endanger global food security ([5 major risks confronting the global economy in 2024](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/5-risks-global-economy-2024/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20tensions%20have%20become%20the,of%20global%20container%20traffic)). Robust international action (like the UN’s grain deal ([PRESS RELEASE: Doomsday Clock set at 90 seconds to midnight - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#:~:text=The%20Doomsday%20Clock%20statement%20explains,Efforts%20by)) and donor conferences) averted the worst famine outcomes, demonstrating that mitigating one piece (food supply) can calm others (political stability). But if two or three big crises hit at once without effective cooperation, the systemic strain could be overwhelming. Experts note that, psychologically, when facing multiple crises, countries may resort to short-term self-interest even more, undermining collective solutions – a dangerous dynamic.

To conclude, **geopolitical risk is deeply interwoven with other global risks**. It can ignite or amplify economic crises, humanitarian crises, and technological crises. In turn, those crises can act as triggers or stressors for geopolitical conflict. Resilience planning, therefore, must be integrative – ensuring, for instance, that peace efforts incorporate climate adaptation (so resource scarcity doesn’t undermine peace agreements), or that cyber defenses are part of military alliances, or that economic safety nets are deployed to regions at risk of conflict due to commodity shocks. The systemic nature of these interactions means siloed approaches won’t suffice. A polycrisis-informed strategy is required: one that seeks co-benefits (e.g., renewable energy investment can reduce climate risk and also lessen the leverage of petrostate adversaries) and anticipates how a shock in one domain could reverberate in others. The era of treating security, economy, and environment as separate buckets is over – as the evidence shows, they form one interconnected global security ecosystem ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=dysfunction%2C%E2%80%9D%20in%20UN%20Secretary%02General%20Antonio,Russia%E2%80%99s%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine%2C%20on)) ([](https://rwo.princeton.edu/document/146#:~:text=been%20greater,Disturbingly%2C%20the%20fissures)).
