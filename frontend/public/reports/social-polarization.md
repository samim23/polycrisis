**Overview: Defining Global Social Polarization in the Polycrisis Era**

The present era is characterized by a confluence of interconnected global crises, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as a polycrisis. This concept describes the causal entanglement of crises across multiple global systems, resulting in a significant degradation of humanity's prospects <sup>1</sup>. These interacting crises produce harms greater than the sum of their individual impacts, highlighting the critical importance of understanding the relationships between various global challenges <sup>3</sup>. Within this complex web of interconnected issues, social polarization emerges as a significant societal component. It can be defined as a complex issue involving ideological and cultural divides that lead to a decline in social stability, persistent gridlock in public decision-making processes, disruptions to economic systems, and an overall increase in political polarization <sup>5</sup>. This phenomenon encompasses not only divisions in the political sphere but also increasing fragmentation within the social sphere, marked by the formation of distinct ideological communities <sup>6</sup>. A key aspect of this division is affective polarization, which refers to the growing animosity and distrust that individuals hold towards those on the opposing side of the political spectrum <sup>7</sup>.

The framework of the polycrisis underscores the interconnected nature of global challenges. Social polarization should not be viewed as an isolated problem but rather as an integral part of a larger system of interacting crises. By eroding trust and hindering cooperation within societies, social polarization can amplify the negative effects of other crises. For instance, deep societal divisions can impede the implementation of effective policies to combat climate change, exacerbate existing economic inequalities by preventing necessary reforms, and fuel geopolitical tensions by fostering distrust and animosity between nations. Conversely, other global crises, such as economic shocks, public health emergencies, or environmental disasters, can also act as catalysts, further deepening existing social and political divides within and between countries. Therefore, understanding social polarization within the context of the polycrisis requires a systemic perspective that acknowledges these complex interactions.

A comprehensive definition of social polarization necessitates the recognition of its multiple dimensions. It is not solely a political phenomenon but also manifests in ideological, cultural, and importantly, affective spheres. Ideological and cultural divides contribute to the formation of distinct societal groups with increasingly divergent values and beliefs <sup>5</sup>. Politically, this translates into increased partisanship and difficulties in achieving consensus. Affectively, the growing dislike and distrust between opposing groups further complicate social interactions and undermine the potential for constructive dialogue <sup>7</sup>. The concept of "toxic polarization" further emphasizes the severity of this issue, suggesting a level of societal division that significantly impairs the ability to address common challenges. When polarization reaches a toxic level, the fundamental trust between citizens and their governments, and even among citizens themselves, erodes, making collective action on pressing issues within the polycrisis exceedingly difficult <sup>3</sup>.

**Current Global Landscape of Social Polarization: An Analysis of Key Indicators**

The current global landscape of social polarization is characterized by concerning trends across various indicators, including income inequality, political polarization indices, and social cohesion metrics.

**Income Inequality: Global and Regional Statistics**

Contemporary levels of global income inequality are alarmingly close to those observed at the peak of Western imperialism in the early 20th century <sup>8</sup>. While some progress has been made in reducing income disparities between countries over the past two decades, a significant and concerning trend is the increasing inequality within most nations <sup>8</sup>. Notably, the gap between the average incomes of the wealthiest 10% of the population and the poorest 50% within countries has nearly doubled <sup>8</sup>. This widening internal disparity is a major issue in our time and acts as a significant driver of political polarization <sup>10</sup>. The stark contrast between the rich and the poor within a society can breed resentment, distrust, and a sense of injustice, all of which contribute to social fragmentation. Furthermore, geographic income inequality has also been on the rise in certain regions, such as the United States, indicating that economic disparities are not only widening between income brackets but also between different geographic locations <sup>11</sup>.

Looking at the historical context, current levels of income inequality, while high, are not entirely unprecedented <sup>8</sup>. However, the globally interconnected nature of the modern world, coupled with the rapid dissemination of information through digital technologies, might amplify the polarizing effects of these inequalities. In past eras of high inequality, societies may have been more geographically isolated, and the awareness of disparities might have been less pervasive. Today, the constant exposure to information about wealth disparities, both within and across borders, can fuel feelings of relative deprivation and contribute to social unrest and political division. The established link between rising income inequality and political polarization suggests a potential reinforcing cycle <sup>10</sup>. Economic disparities can lead to political divisions as different income groups advocate for divergent policies. In turn, a polarized political system may struggle to enact effective measures to address income inequality, thus perpetuating the cycle of division.

To provide a clearer picture of the current state of income inequality, the following table summarizes key global metrics and regional variations:

**Political Polarization Indices: Trends and Severity**

The phenomenon of increasing political polarization is not confined to a single nation but is evident across various regions worldwide, although the specific patterns and intensities can differ significantly <sup>12</sup>. In several regional powers, such as Brazil, India, and TÃ¼rkiye, political polarization has reached what experts describe as "toxic" levels, with observable increasing trends since the year 2000 <sup>15</sup>. The V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) project, which tracks political polarization, employs a reversed scale where higher scores indicate a more severe state of polarization <sup>15</sup>. This signifies that in these nations, political animosity extends beyond mere policy disagreements and permeates broader societal interactions.

While the World Bank also estimates a Polarization Index, accessing detailed global trends from this source appears to require specific technical capabilities to interact with their data platform <sup>16</sup>. However, research indicates that the United States has experienced a particularly sharp increase in affective polarization compared to other established democracies <sup>17</sup>. This form of polarization, characterized by negative feelings and distrust towards the opposing political party, has been on a significant upward trajectory since the 1970s in the US <sup>17</sup>. This trend is further evidenced by the expanding partisan gaps on critical issues such as the appropriate role and power of the federal government, approaches to climate change, and policies regarding immigration <sup>20</sup>. The concept of "toxic" polarization is particularly relevant here, suggesting that in highly polarized contexts, political hostility can spill over into everyday life, affecting social relationships, participation in civic activities, and overall societal trust. Furthermore, the existence of asymmetry in polarization in some contexts, notably the US, suggests that the underlying factors and dynamics driving this phenomenon may not be uniform across the political spectrum, necessitating a more nuanced and targeted approach to analysis and intervention <sup>21</sup>.

To illustrate the trends in political polarization, the following table presents data for selected countries and regions:

|                    |                                              |                               |                             |                              |

| Brazil             | V-Dem Political Polarization (Reversed)      | Steep Increase                | Very High                   | <sup>15</sup>, <sup>15</sup> |
| India              | V-Dem Political Polarization (Reversed)      | Steep Increase                | High                        | <sup>15</sup>, <sup>15</sup> |
| TÃ¼rkiye            | V-Dem Political Polarization (Reversed)      | Gradual Increase              | Highest among the three     | <sup>15</sup>, <sup>15</sup> |
| United States      | Affective Polarization (Feeling Thermometer) | Significant Increase          | High                        | <sup>17</sup>, <sup>18</sup> |

**Social Cohesion Metrics: Measuring Societal Fragmentation**

Social cohesion, which encompasses the feelings of connectedness and belonging among individuals within a society, as well as attitudes of mutual respect between different social groups, is another critical indicator of societal fragmentation <sup>22</sup>. The global average Social Capital Score, as measured in 2024, stands at 44, revealing a considerable gap from an ideal state <sup>24</sup>. This index highlights significant disparities between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with nations in the North generally exhibiting higher scores <sup>24</sup>. Notably, the United States ranks relatively low in this index (118th) due to factors such as comparatively high crime rates, limited availability of health services, and increasing income inequality <sup>24</sup>. These contributing factors directly align with potential drivers and consequences of social polarization, suggesting a complex interplay between these societal challenges.

In Australia, the Scanlon Index of Social Cohesion has remained relatively stable between 2023 and 2024, registering a score of 78 in both years <sup>25</sup>. While this stability might suggest resilience in the face of national and global pressures, the index remains approximately six points lower than its average during the 2010s and at its equal lowest level since its inception in 2007 <sup>25</sup>. This indicates that even in societies often considered relatively cohesive, there are persistent challenges and a potential erosion of social bonds over time. A particularly concerning global trend is the observed decline in trust in institutions worldwide, a phenomenon especially acute in lower-income countries and among younger generations <sup>27</sup>. This erosion of trust, a fundamental component of social cohesion, can significantly impact a society's ability to function effectively and respond to crises. Low social cohesion can weaken social networks, reduce cooperation among citizens, and increase vulnerability to societal fragmentation when confronted with the shocks and stresses of the polycrisis.

The following table presents Social Capital Index scores for selected countries alongside trends in institutional trust:

**Trends and Projections: How the risk is evolving over time**

**Historical Trends: The Last Ten Years**

Over the past decade, many nations across the globe have witnessed a discernible increase in political polarization <sup>12</sup>. This trend is particularly pronounced in the realm of affective polarization, where negative sentiments towards opposing political groups have intensified significantly in countries like the United States since the 1970s <sup>17</sup>. Interestingly, this period has also seen the emergence of a growing divide in liberal and anti-patriarchal values between younger men and women, indicating a complex evolution of societal divisions that extends beyond traditional political fault lines <sup>29</sup>. Concurrently, global income inequality within countries has also been on the rise over the last two decades, suggesting a possible link between economic disparities and increasing social and political fragmentation <sup>8</sup>. Furthermore, a concerning trend observed over the past decade is the consistently low levels of trust in governments and established institutions across various regions, potentially exacerbating the effects of polarization and hindering collective action <sup>30</sup>. The convergence of these trends â increasing political polarization, widening income inequality within nations, and declining public trust â paints a concerning picture of an eroding social fabric worldwide over the last ten years. These developments are likely interconnected, with economic hardships potentially fueling political divisions and undermining faith in institutions to address these challenges effectively. The emerging gender divide in values further underscores the intricate and shifting nature of social polarization, suggesting the interplay of various societal cleavages beyond the conventional left-right spectrum. While some data might indicate a recent plateauing of within-country income inequality <sup>8</sup>, the already elevated levels of disparity and the continued upward trajectory of political polarization suggest that the social and political ramifications of these trends are still unfolding and warrant close observation.

**Driving Forces Shaping Future Trajectories**

The trajectory of social polarization in the coming years is likely to be shaped by several powerful driving forces. The super electoral year of 2024 has already revealed underlying societal fragilities and a notable shift towards the ideological right in many countries, raising concerns about a potential further increase in polarization globally <sup>14</sup>. The World Economic Forum has also cautioned that diminishing trust in institutions, coupled with increasing political polarization and a volatile geopolitical landscape, could significantly limit the potential for international cooperation on critical global challenges <sup>32</sup>. The continued advancement and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various aspects of life presents another significant factor. Research suggests that AI and related technologies have the potential to further exacerbate existing economic inequalities, which, as discussed earlier, are a key driver of social division and polarization <sup>10</sup>. Moreover, the psychological dynamic of overperceiving polarization and reacting to it could create a self-reinforcing cycle, leading to a further escalation of societal divisions <sup>34</sup>. Finally, the enduring influence of right-wing populism in numerous regions around the world indicates a continued potential for the exploitation and amplification of societal divisions for political gain, further shaping the future trajectory of social polarization <sup>35</sup>.

**Key Drivers and Mechanisms: Underlying factors accelerating or mitigating the risk**

**Economic Inequality: A Catalyst for Division**

Extensive research indicates that economic inequality serves as a significant underlying factor that accelerates social polarization. Studies have established a strong link between economic inequality and the erosion of democratic norms, with inequality also acting as a catalyst for partisan polarization <sup>36</sup>. In conditions of rising wealth inequality or economic decline, a discernible pattern emerges where certain segments of the population tend to adopt risk-averse strategies that favor their in-group, consequently leading to heightened polarization within society <sup>37</sup>. Over time, partisanship has increasingly become stratified along income lines, suggesting that economic status plays a growing role in shaping political affiliations <sup>38</sup>. Furthermore, socio-economic disparities observed between different geographic regions can also fuel divergent patterns of affective polarization, indicating that localized economic conditions contribute to the broader phenomenon of societal division <sup>39</sup>. In the context of global risks, income inequality is recognized as a central and highly interconnected factor, playing a significant role in both triggering and being influenced by other risks, including social polarization <sup>40</sup>. The consistent evidence across various studies underscores that economic inequality is a fundamental driver of social and political polarization, operating through a range of mechanisms that affect individuals and societies at large. Economic insecurity and the perception of unfair distribution of wealth can create a fertile ground for social division and the rise of extremist ideologies, as individuals and groups seek explanations for their economic circumstances and often identify out-groups as scapegoats.

**The Role of Identity Politics in Fostering Polarization**

The increasing prominence of identity politics in many parts of the world has also been identified as a key driver in fostering social polarization. For a growing number of individuals, their political beliefs and affiliations are becoming deeply intertwined with their social identities <sup>41</sup>. This phenomenon can lead to situations where individuals exhibit risk-averse attitudes towards those belonging to different identity groups, which can then evolve into affective polarization between supporters of opposing political parties <sup>42</sup>. While identity politics can serve as an important platform for marginalized communities to voice their grievances and advocate for their rights, it also carries the inherent risk of exacerbating social divisions by placing a strong emphasis on differences between groups and potentially cultivating animosity towards those outside one's own group <sup>43</sup>. For many, partisan identity has transformed into a core aspect of their social identity, meaning that political affiliations are not just about policy preferences but are deeply connected to their sense of self and belonging <sup>41</sup>. The emotional and identity-based nature of affective polarization makes it particularly challenging to address through purely rational or evidence-based approaches <sup>42</sup>. Interventions aimed at reducing this type of polarization need to consider and engage with the underlying emotions, social identities, and group dynamics rather than solely focusing on disagreements over policy. The "us versus them" mentality that is often fueled by identity politics can be detrimental to social cohesion, undermining the sense of a shared national identity and hindering the ability of diverse groups to collaborate on addressing collective challenges, such as the multifaceted issues presented by the polycrisis <sup>43</sup>. When political identity becomes a dominant social identity, it can unfortunately lead to the dehumanization of those with opposing views and a significant erosion of trust across societal divides.

**Misinformation and the Erosion of Shared Reality**

The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation in the modern digital age has emerged as a significant driver of social polarization, contributing to the erosion of a shared understanding of reality. These false or misleading narratives have the capacity to fuel societal divisions and undermine the foundations of democracy <sup>4</sup>. Disturbingly, political polarization itself can act as a trigger for the dissemination of misinformation that is skewed to favor one's own in-group, further exacerbating the problem <sup>50</sup>. Paradoxically, even heightened concern about the prevalence of misinformation might inadvertently contribute to increased polarization in individuals' media consumption habits <sup>51</sup>. Social media platforms, with their widespread reach and algorithmic amplification, have played a pivotal role in the polarization of views on a wide range of issues <sup>52</sup>. Adding to the complexity of this challenge is the growing sophistication and accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which can be used to generate increasingly realistic and personalized misinformation, posing a significant and evolving threat to societal cohesion <sup>48</sup>. The deliberate creation and spread of misinformation acts as a potent accelerant of social polarization by constructing parallel and often contradictory realities, thereby eroding trust in established and credible sources of information. When individuals are constantly bombarded with conflicting narratives, it becomes increasingly difficult to establish common ground and engage in productive and fact-based dialogue across ideological divides. The observed feedback loop between political polarization and the propagation of misinformation is particularly concerning, as it suggests a self-perpetuating cycle where existing societal divisions lead to the creation and spread of more misinformation, which in turn serves to deepen the initial polarization <sup>50</sup>. This cyclical dynamic presents a significant obstacle to effectively addressing the fundamental causes of polarization. The increasing role of AI in generating highly sophisticated and tailored misinformation represents a critical future challenge. The ability of AI to produce content that is nearly indistinguishable from authentic information, coupled with its capacity for rapid and widespread dissemination, could dramatically amplify the scale and impact of disinformation campaigns, potentially leading to even greater societal fragmentation and instability.

**Fragmentation of Media Landscapes and Echo Chambers**

The evolving media landscape, characterized by increasing fragmentation, has also been identified as a key driver of social polarization. This fragmentation leads to a phenomenon known as selective exposure, where individuals tend to gravitate towards and consume media sources that align with their pre-existing beliefs, thereby reinforcing their viewpoints and contributing to polarization <sup>55</sup>. Research consistently shows that exposure to pro-attitudinal media, or media that confirms one's existing opinions, tends to exacerbate political polarization <sup>12</sup>. The rise of social media platforms and their underlying algorithms further contribute to this issue by creating what are often referred to as echo chambers or filter bubbles <sup>7</sup>. These algorithmic systems often prioritize content that is likely to be engaging to individual users based on their past interactions, inadvertently limiting their exposure to diverse or opposing perspectives. This can result in individuals primarily encountering information that confirms their existing biases, further solidifying their beliefs and reducing their willingness to consider alternative viewpoints. The deliberate specialization of media outlets to cater to specific ideological leanings represents another significant mechanism through which media fragmentation contributes to polarization <sup>57</sup>. By offering news and commentary that is tailored to particular political viewpoints, these outlets can attract and retain audiences who already agree with their stance, further segmenting the media landscape and potentially amplifying partisan viewpoints. While social media often receives significant attention in discussions about media fragmentation and polarization, it is important to note that the growth of affective polarization actually predates the widespread adoption of the internet. This suggests that traditional media sources, such as partisan cable news networks and talk radio programs, have also played a substantial role in shaping the current polarized environment <sup>21</sup>. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between media and social polarization must take into account the influence of both traditional and newer digital platforms.

**Impacts and Cascading Effects: Consequences across different domains and potential feedback loops**

**Political Instability and Democratic Erosion**

Deep social polarization has profound and detrimental consequences for political stability and the health of democratic systems. It often leads to persistent gridlock in the processes of public decision-making, making it exceedingly difficult for governments to address critical issues and enact necessary legislation <sup>5</sup>. In its more extreme forms, social polarization can actively undermine the very foundations of democratic governance, potentially leading to democratic backsliding and even erosion <sup>7</sup>. Research indicates a strong correlation between severe levels of polarization and a significant decline in the quality and functioning of democratic institutions <sup>63</sup>. This is often manifested through an erosion of trust in democratic institutions themselves, as citizens become increasingly disillusioned with the political process and the ability of their elected officials to represent their interests effectively <sup>45</sup>. The emergence of a strong "us versus them" mentality in highly polarized societies can result in political opponents being viewed not merely as rivals with differing policy ideas but as outright enemies who must be defeated at all costs, thereby severely hindering the prospects for compromise and constructive political dialogue <sup>45</sup>. The alarming statistic that a significant proportion of democracies that reach pernicious levels of polarization subsequently experience a downgrading of their democratic status underscores the gravity of this impact and highlights the urgent need for effective strategies to mitigate societal divisions <sup>63</sup>.

**Implications for Economic Growth and Development**

Social and political polarization has significant negative implications for economic growth and overall development. Excessive levels of inequality, a key driver of polarization, have been shown to correlate with lower rates of economic growth <sup>9</sup>. Furthermore, political polarization itself exerts a direct negative effect on critical economic indicators such as output growth, capital formation, and the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) <sup>64</sup>. Studies have also demonstrated that political polarization can hinder economic growth by negatively impacting private investment, the development of human capital, and overall productivity within an economy <sup>65</sup>. One of the key mechanisms through which polarization affects economic activity is by increasing economic policy uncertainty. In highly polarized environments, businesses and investors face greater unpredictability regarding future government policies and regulations, which can lead to a reluctance to invest and expand <sup>65</sup>. Notably, research suggests that company investments are particularly sensitive to the levels of political polarization within a country <sup>67</sup>. The observed negative relationship between polarization and aggregate investment indicates that societal divisions can have tangible and detrimental effects on the overall economic health and development prospects of nations.

**The Undermining of Social Cohesion and Trust**

Social polarization has a profound and pervasive impact on the fundamental elements of social cohesion and trust within a society. It leads to increased social fragmentation, effectively deepening the divides between different groups and significantly hindering the potential for constructive dialogue and mutual understanding across these divides <sup>68</sup>. One of the most damaging consequences of this polarization is the erosion of mutual trust and the capacity for cooperation among diverse groups within a society <sup>68</sup>. As societies become increasingly characterized by uncertainty, inequality, and polarization, the very strength of the social contract that binds citizens and states together weakens considerably <sup>28</sup>. The emotional dimension of polarization plays a critical role in this erosion, as the anger and hostility directed towards out-groups make it exceptionally challenging to build bridges, foster empathy, and cultivate a sense of shared community <sup>68</sup>. Ultimately, the undermining of social cohesion and trust weakens a society's overall resilience and its ability to come together to effectively address common challenges, including the complex and interconnected crises that define the polycrisis era. When the foundational bonds of trust and cooperation are frayed by polarization, the capacity for collective action and mutual support in times of need is significantly diminished.

**Public Health Challenges in a Polarized World**

The increasing levels of political polarization worldwide present significant challenges to public health efforts and outcomes. Research indicates that polarization can obstruct the implementation of crucial health-related legislation and policies, discourage individuals from taking necessary preventative health actions, and contribute to the widespread dissemination of misinformation regarding health issues <sup>72</sup>. Notably, partisan identities have been shown to significantly influence health behaviors, as was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic <sup>74</sup>. Individuals who identify strongly with a particular political ideology, especially those further from the political center, tend to experience a deterioration in both their physical and mental health <sup>72</sup>. This polarization can also undermine collective action on critical public health risks, as individuals may be reluctant to accept information or adhere to recommendations that contradict their political affiliations <sup>74</sup>. Alarmingly, health choices are increasingly aligning with individuals' political identities rather than being guided by medical advice or scientific consensus <sup>75</sup>. The comparison between the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and Canada serves as a stark reminder that policy decisions and leadership approaches can either mitigate or exacerbate the negative health consequences of political polarization <sup>72</sup>.

**Impact on International Relations and Cooperation**

Domestic social and political polarization has significant repercussions for a nation's ability to engage effectively in international relations and contribute to global cooperation. High levels of polarization can undermine a country's capacity to act as a stable and reliable force on the global stage <sup>76</sup>. This internal division often translates into volatility and a lack of consistency in foreign policy objectives and implementation <sup>76</sup>. A notable trend in recent decades has been the decline in bipartisan agreement on foreign policy issues, particularly in the United States <sup>77</sup>. This lack of domestic consensus weakens the effectiveness of a nation's foreign policy and can significantly harm its international reputation and credibility <sup>77</sup>. Foreign policy professionals increasingly recognize domestic polarization as a major threat to their country's standing and influence in the world, often ranking it above traditional geopolitical concerns <sup>78</sup>. In highly polarized contexts, there is a risk that domestic political considerations and partisan goals may take precedence over the need for international cooperation on pressing global issues, such as those encompassed by the polycrisis <sup>77</sup>. This can lead to a diminished capacity for collective action and a weakening of international institutions and agreements that are essential for addressing shared global challenges.

**Geographic Variations: How the risk differs across regions**

**Case Studies of Polarization in Different Regions**

Social polarization manifests in diverse ways and with varying intensity across different regions of the world, reflecting the unique interplay of historical, cultural, economic, and political factors in each context. In North America, particularly the United States, the pace and extent of the increase in affective polarization stand out compared to other developed nations within the OECD <sup>17</sup>. East Asia presents a mixed picture, with South Korea exhibiting high levels of political polarization, similar to the US <sup>79</sup>. Europe has witnessed a general rise in polarization, with more pronounced increases observed in its Eastern and Southern regions <sup>80</sup>. South Asia has also experienced significant shifts, with India's polarization levels surging dramatically since 2014 <sup>80</sup>. In Latin America, several countries, including Argentina and Colombia, are currently facing severe levels of polarization <sup>80</sup>. Southeast Asia provides examples of regional polarization in post-conflict settings, such as in Thailand, where divisions are rooted in socio-economic disparities and regional identities, and in the Bangsamoro region of the Philippines, where polarization has emerged from political competition and historical conflicts <sup>82</sup>. The African continent has historically experienced high levels of polarization, often linked to ethnic and political divisions <sup>80</sup>. These case studies illustrate that while social polarization is a global phenomenon, its specific characteristics and underlying causes are deeply contextual.

**Factors Contributing to Regional Differences**

The factors that contribute to the observed regional variations in social polarization are complex and multifaceted. In the United States, potential drivers include racial divisions, the polarization of political elites, and the pervasive influence of cable television news consumption <sup>61</sup>. Across different countries, economic uncertainty and inequality, coupled with a lack of trust in institutions, appear to be significant correlates of polarization <sup>81</sup>. The geographic distribution of populations, particularly the divide between rural and urban areas, can also contribute to political and social polarization within nations <sup>39</sup>. Furthermore, the alignment of deeply held cultural values with existing political divisions plays a crucial role in shaping the landscape of polarization in various regions <sup>85</sup>. In the specific context of the United States, historical legacies, including long-standing racial tensions, and prevailing socio-economic factors continue to exert a strong influence on contemporary patterns of polarization <sup>70</sup>. The way in which information is disseminated and consumed within different regions, including the strength and reach of partisan media ecosystems, also appears to be a critical factor in explaining the variations in polarization observed across the globe <sup>86</sup>. Ultimately, understanding the regional differences in social polarization requires a nuanced analysis that considers the unique combination and interplay of these diverse economic, social, political, cultural, and media-related factors in each specific context.

**Adaptation and Mitigation: Current efforts and their effectiveness**

**Local Initiatives: Community-Based Approaches**

Efforts to adapt to and mitigate social polarization are being undertaken at various levels, with local, community-based initiatives playing a vital role. Local governments are exploring strategies to overcome polarization by fostering more inclusive engagement processes, emphasizing shared community outcomes rather than focusing solely on contentious arguments, promoting public education and transparency, and utilizing diverse communication channels to reach a broader spectrum of residents <sup>87</sup>. Recognizing the importance of engaging younger generations, some cities and organizations are establishing dedicated youth engagement units and creating safe spaces where young people can engage in constructive dialogue and express their perspectives on societal issues <sup>89</sup>. Grassroots organizations, such as Braver Angels, are actively working to bridge political divides by organizing events and workshops that promote respectful conversations and encourage individuals with differing viewpoints to find common ground <sup>90</sup>. Additionally, community mediation programs and the formation of cross-partisan discussion groups are being implemented in various locations with the aim of rebuilding trust and fostering understanding across ideological lines <sup>91</sup>. These local initiatives, by focusing on direct engagement and relationship building at the community level, can contribute to a reduction in animosity and the cultivation of empathy among individuals with diverse perspectives.

**National Policies Aimed at Reducing Polarization**

At the national level, various policy approaches are being considered and implemented to address the challenge of social polarization. One key area of focus is electoral reform, with proposals to address partisan gerrymandering and explore alternative electoral systems that could foster more competitive races and reduce the incentive for extreme partisanship among elected officials <sup>86</sup>. Recognizing the significant role of information consumption in shaping political attitudes, there are also national-level efforts aimed at promoting media literacy among citizens, empowering them to critically evaluate information sources and identify misinformation. Additionally, some advocate for regulatory measures to ensure responsible journalism and counteract the spread of harmful disinformation <sup>50</sup>. Strengthening civic education within national curricula is another proposed policy aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of democratic values, the importance of civil discourse, and the necessity of compromise in effective governance <sup>86</sup>. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the characteristics of individuals who choose to run for political office play a crucial role in the level of polarization observed in legislative bodies. Proposals to make political office more appealing to moderate individuals, such as increasing legislator salaries and implementing campaign finance reforms that reduce the pressure to cater to extreme partisan donors, are being discussed as potential national-level strategies to reduce polarization <sup>93</sup>.

**International Efforts and Collaborations**

The global nature of social polarization has spurred the development of various international efforts and collaborations aimed at understanding and mitigating this complex challenge. The Global Initiative on Polarization, a collaborative effort between IFIT (the Institute for Integrated Transitions) and the Ford Foundation, represents a significant international undertaking focused on fostering a deeper global understanding of the diverse causes, consequences, and potential solutions to growing polarization in both democratic and non-democratic settings <sup>94</sup>. This initiative supports interdisciplinary research, facilitates structured convenings of experts and practitioners, and promotes applied work in a wide range of countries across the globe <sup>94</sup>. The King Center at Stanford University has also established a Conflict and Polarization Initiative, which engages in multidisciplinary research and fosters partnerships with universities and organizations in Europe, Israel, and Mexico, among others, to test new ideas for reducing violent conflict and political polarization <sup>96</sup>. Furthermore, international organizations and human rights bodies increasingly recognize the crucial role that civil society organizations play in combating polarization and addressing the underlying inequalities that often fuel societal divisions <sup>97</sup>. These international efforts underscore the shared global concern about the risks posed by social polarization and the growing recognition that collaborative, cross-border approaches are necessary to effectively address this multifaceted challenge.

**Critical Uncertainties: Major unknowns in our understanding**

**The Long-Term Impact of Artificial Intelligence**

The long-term consequences of the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) on social polarization remain a significant area of uncertainty. While AI holds immense potential for societal benefit, there are also growing concerns about its potential to exacerbate existing divisions and create new challenges. Some research suggests that AI could further increase economic inequality through automation and the concentration of wealth, which is a known driver of social polarization <sup>10</sup>. Moreover, AI technologies are increasingly being used to enhance digital propaganda, create sophisticated echo chambers online, and generate highly realistic but false content, such as deepfakes, which could be used to spread misinformation and further polarize the electorate <sup>48</sup>. While some speculate on the potential for AI to also be used as a tool for mitigating polarization, the current emphasis in research and public discourse leans heavily towards the risks associated with its misuse. The long-term effects of AI on labor markets, income distribution, and the overall structure of society are still largely unknown, adding another layer of uncertainty to its potential impact on social cohesion and division. The absence of comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks governing the development and deployment of AI technologies further complicates the prediction of its future role in shaping social polarization <sup>54</sup>.

**Potential for Unexpected Social and Political Shifts**

The dynamics of social polarization are complex and potentially non-linear, meaning that the future trajectory of this phenomenon could be marked by unexpected social and political shifts that are difficult to foresee. Research suggests that political polarization can become a self-reinforcing cycle, where increased division leads to further division in a way that is not always predictable <sup>34</sup>. The electoral landscape of 2024 has already demonstrated the potential for surprising outcomes and shifts in political sentiment across many countries, highlighting the inherent unpredictability of social and political trends <sup>14</sup>. External shocks, such as major economic crises, global pandemics, or significant geopolitical events, can act as catalysts that either unite societies in the face of a common threat or, conversely, exacerbate existing social and political fault lines, leading to increased polarization <sup>99</sup>. Furthermore, some research indicates that polarization processes can reach tipping points, beyond which the rate of division accelerates rapidly and becomes increasingly difficult to reverse <sup>60</sup>. These potential for sudden and significant shifts underscores the need for continuous monitoring and analysis of the factors driving social polarization, as well as the development of flexible and adaptable strategies for responding to unexpected developments.

**Effectiveness of Depolarization Strategies**

The effectiveness of various strategies aimed at depolarizing societies remains a critical uncertainty in our understanding of how to address social division. While numerous local, national, and international initiatives are underway, the long-term impact and scalability of many common bridging interventions, such as face-to-face dialogues or in-person training sessions, might be limited <sup>101</sup>. Some research offers promising avenues, such as the finding that correcting misperceptions about the prevailing attitudes within one's own political group (ingroup norm perception) can lead to a reduction in affective polarization <sup>103</sup>. However, historical analysis suggests that achieving sustained depolarization from deeply entrenched levels is a rare occurrence in liberal democracies and often requires significant systemic shocks or major societal upheavals <sup>63</sup>. Furthermore, research into the psychological underpinnings of polarization suggests that individuals with a lower tolerance for uncertainty might be more susceptible to black-and-white political views, potentially making depolarization efforts more challenging for this segment of the population <sup>104</sup>. Once polarized ways of thinking become deeply ingrained within individuals and societies, they can be remarkably resistant to change <sup>105</sup>. These uncertainties highlight the complexity of the challenge and the need for continued research and evaluation to identify effective and sustainable strategies for fostering depolarization and building more cohesive societies.

**Expert Consensus: Areas of agreement and disagreement among experts**

**Areas of Agreement on Causes and Impacts**

There is a considerable degree of consensus among experts regarding several key aspects of social polarization. A widely held view is that political elites, such as elected officials, tend to be significantly more ideologically polarized than the general public <sup>21</sup>. Experts also agree that affective polarization, characterized by negative feelings and animosity towards the opposing political party, is a substantial and growing problem in many societies <sup>13</sup>. A significant contributing factor to this affective polarization is the widespread misperception that partisans hold about the demographics, policy beliefs, and fundamental values of those in the opposing party <sup>21</sup>. The role of media, both traditional outlets like cable news and talk radio, as well as social media platforms, in contributing to the increase in both ideological and affective polarization is also an area of general agreement among researchers <sup>12</sup>. Furthermore, there is a strong consensus that underlying socio-economic factors, particularly income inequality, play a critical role in driving social and political divisions <sup>10</sup>. Finally, experts largely agree that high levels of social polarization have negative consequences for democratic norms and institutions, potentially leading to political instability and a weakening of democratic processes <sup>7</sup>. This broad agreement on the multifaceted nature and detrimental impacts of social polarization underscores the urgency of addressing this complex global challenge.

**Points of Disagreement on Trends and Solutions**

While there is considerable agreement on the fundamental aspects of social polarization, experts also hold differing views on certain trends and the most effective solutions. One area of ongoing debate is the extent to which social media platforms are a primary driver of political polarization, with some research suggesting a more nuanced role than often portrayed in public discourse <sup>58</sup>. Experts also have differing opinions on whether polarization is always a negative phenomenon for societies, with some arguing that it can, in certain contexts, be a mobilizing force for social change <sup>108</sup>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the complexity of the issue, there is no single, universally agreed-upon solution for effectively depolarizing societies, and various approaches are being explored and debated <sup>108</sup>. Some research suggests that the level of ideological polarization among the general voting public might be less extreme than commonly perceived, with the greater division being observed among political elites <sup>21</sup>. Finally, a more fundamental point of disagreement exists around the very definition of polarization itself, with scholars from different disciplines sometimes employing varying conceptualizations of the term <sup>100</sup>. These areas of disagreement highlight the intricate nature of social polarization and the ongoing need for further research and interdisciplinary dialogue to refine our understanding and develop more effective strategies for mitigation.

**System Interactions: How this risk interacts with other global challenges**

**Social Polarization as a Driver and Consequence of Other Risks**

Social polarization is not an isolated phenomenon but rather exists within a complex web of interconnected global risks, acting as both a significant driver and a consequence of other major challenges. Research indicates that societal polarization is closely linked to economic decline and has a wide-ranging impact on numerous other risks within the global risk landscape <sup>4</sup>. Prominent global risk reports from organizations like the World Economic Forum and Zurich consistently identify societal polarization as one of the top risks facing the world in both the short and long term <sup>48</sup>. It is deeply interconnected with other critical risks, including the spread of misinformation and disinformation, escalating geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis <sup>48</sup>. Notably, income inequality is often perceived as the most central risk within this interconnected network, playing a significant role in both triggering and being influenced by the dynamics of social polarization <sup>40</sup>. The presence of deep societal divisions can also significantly hinder the ability of nations and the international community to effectively address other pressing global challenges, such as taking meaningful action on climate change and coordinating responses to global public health emergencies like pandemics <sup>47</sup>. Furthermore, high levels of social polarization can contribute to increased social unrest, political instability, and even violent conflict within and between countries <sup>31</sup>. This interconnectedness underscores the systemic nature of the polycrisis and highlights the importance of addressing social polarization not only as a challenge in itself but also as a critical factor that can amplify or impede our ability to tackle other major global risks.

**Conclusions**

The analysis presented in this report underscores the critical nature of global social polarization as a systemic risk within the context of the ongoing polycrisis. The evidence indicates that societies worldwide are experiencing increasing divisions along ideological, political, and social lines, driven by a complex interplay of economic inequalities, the rise of identity politics, the proliferation of misinformation, and the fragmentation of media landscapes. This polarization has far-reaching and detrimental impacts, threatening political stability, hindering economic growth and development, undermining social cohesion and trust, posing significant challenges to public health, and straining international relations and cooperation.

Geographic variations in social polarization highlight the context-specific nature of this risk, with different regions exhibiting unique patterns and intensities influenced by their distinct historical, cultural, economic, and political circumstances. While various adaptation and mitigation efforts are being implemented at local, national, and international levels, the long-term effectiveness and scalability of these strategies remain uncertain. The potential for artificial intelligence to further exacerbate polarization, coupled with the possibility of unexpected social and political shifts, adds to the complexity of this challenge.

Expert consensus largely agrees on the severity of social polarization and its negative consequences, as well as the significant roles played by elite behavior, public misperceptions, media influences, and economic disparities as key drivers. However, disagreements persist regarding the relative importance of certain factors, such as social media, and on the most effective approaches to depolarization.

Ultimately, social polarization is deeply interconnected with other global challenges within the polycrisis, acting as both a driver and a consequence of risks like economic inequality, misinformation, and geopolitical tensions. Addressing this complex and pervasive risk requires a multi-dimensional approach that tackles its root causes, fosters dialogue and understanding across divides, strengthens societal resilience, and promotes international cooperation. Failure to effectively mitigate social polarization will likely impede global efforts to address the broader polycrisis and secure a sustainable and equitable future.
