# Polycrisis

## Overview

Polycrisis is an online platform that helps users understand the interconnected nature of global crises, assess risks, and develop preparation strategies. This platform leverages advanced AI tools to research and analyze the state of the global polycrisis from multiple perspectives, integrating insights across disciplines to assess risks in ways that would be impossible for any single human analyst.

The project consists of:

1. A **Frontend** built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that provides interactive visualizations and information about global systemic risks
2. A **Backend** with AI-powered web browsing agents that gather comprehensive data and generates analysis on polycrisis factors

**Note:** Both the frontend and backend directories contain their own README.md files with more detailed information about each component.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer) for the frontend
- Python 3.9+ for the backend
- Chrome/Chromium browser installed (for backend web browsing)
- OpenAI API key

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd polycrisis/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup

View the [backend README](backend/README.md) for more information.

## Current Status

This project is under active development:

- The frontend provides a functional interface for exploring risk data
- The backend AI agent is experimental and not yet integrated with the frontend
- Many features are works in progress

## Future Work

- Integration between frontend and backend components
- Expanded risk data coverage
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Improved AI agent capabilities
